Prior research has demonstrated that food of ethical origin subjectively tastes better to consumers who embrace ethical values. Since meat avoiders generally internalize the values associated with the avoidance of animal-derived products, higher levels of compassion are expected to enhance the subjective taste of meatless food choices, which has implications for lowering barriers to the adoption of vegetarian diets. Three experimental laboratory studies demonstrate that compassion improves the subjective taste of meatless foodstuffs and increases meat avoidance intent, which translates into a higher probability to choose a vegetarian wrap rather than a meat-containing wrap. Two online studies illuminate the underlying psychological process, which is mediated by perceived self-similarity to human and non-human animals. Identifying individual traits that are associated with heightened enjoyment of meatless foods facilitates marketing segmentation for meatless foodstuffs. Furthermore, the tested compassion-inducing visual stimuli can be adapted for product packaging or employed in restaurant décor to elevate consumers’ subjective taste of meatless foods, potentially counteracting the negative individual and societal health effects of excessive meat intake. The moderating effect of meat avoidance intent on subjective taste suggests that, for people who consider reducing their meat intake, transitory zones exist where the perceived enhancement in taste of vegetarian food is not sufficiently motivating to change dietary practices permanently and it may appear more rewarding to simply revert to meat consumption. Social marketers can focus on these zones where moral conflict about meat consumption is salient by providing support to make dietary transitions less frustrating. This set of studies is the first to articulate the connection between compassion and ethical food choices in a consumer-relevant cont', 'Barriers to vegetarianism', '93', 104272, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.104272', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105864006&doi=10.1016%2fj.foodqual.2021.104272&partnerID=40&md5=9a81fddd8f8f5eaea4a0fd73dfeecf20', '2-s2.0-85105864006', 1),

These technologies provide new tools to face the issues of contemporary society (poverty, migrations, sustainable development challenges, governance, etc.). Among them, blockchain emerge as a disruptive technology able to make things in a completely different and innovative way. They can provide solutions where before there were none. Recently, these technologies have become subject of intense research and development by industry and academia. In consequence, a large amount of interesting works is published in many areas, proposing solutions, services, frameworks and applications based on these technologies. The research focusing on the previous challenges are especially interesting in current society. However, the proposals arrive at higher speed than society can assimilate them, and sometimes they are not properly exploited. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology to identify what are its key attributes that enable to successfully address the social challenges. The review has been conducted from three point of views: service-delivery, resource-management and city-administration, and has been focused on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in order to cover the full agenda of current social issues.

On the other hand, priming certain values (e.g., wealth) undermines support for pro-environmental behaviours. Based on these findings, we explored whether situational materialism may amplify the differences between women and men in scepticism towards climate change. In three experiments we presented participants with either images portraying luxury consumption or neutral images, and then we measured scepticism. Study 1 showed that men increased their scepticism over women when they were exposed to luxury consumption, but not to neutral images. Studies 2–3 replicated these results and further explored the influence of gender roles. Conformity to male roles was associated with greater scepticism in both studies, and such association was amplified by situational materialism, but only in Study 2. Thus, situational materialism in men and conformity to male roles, in general, might hamper the fight against climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.', 'Climate change', '96', 104163, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1016/j.jesp.2021.104163', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106324153&doi=10.1016%2fj.jesp.2021.104163&partnerID=40&md5=eb7544f2fd953857c374deb131da100d', '2-s2.0-85106324153', 3),

However, it is still unclear to what extent hydropower is or not environmentally sustainable. The literature reveals i) that no truly holistic assessments have been carried out and ii) that there are contradictory results and conclusions. The present study addresses this gap by conducting a holistic assessment, using eight biophysical indicators of different approaches, and taking two different hydropower plant schemes as study cases. The results of the assessment show that the run-of-river hydropower plant study case is by far more environmentally sustainable than the dam hydropower plant scheme. As hydropower schemes and sizes vary, it is highlighted the importance of including as many indicators as possible to ensure broader and complete assessments and the avoidance of bias in the conclusions and ease comparison with other low-carbon combustion-free energy sources and their technologies. Moreover, the present study addresses how and within which parameters the environmental sustainability of hydropower is usually determined. The complementary set of indicators provided here, which have different scope and complexity, could be adopted for improving future decision-making in energy policies and specifically for hydropower. © 2021 The Author(s)', 'Biophysical assessment', '127', 107748, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107748', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104983422&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107748&partnerID=40&md5=486781156dc053940fcd73afc6b42dae', '2-s2.0-85104983422', 4),

While a significant body of research has focused on analyzing the socioeconomic drivers of deforestation in the Amazon basin, far less attention has been paid to explaining why Amazonian people use chemicals in agricultural production. Using data from a household survey, this paper aims at analyzing the drivers of expenditure on chemical fertilizers and pesticides among Kichwa and mestizo colonist populations in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon. The results show that most households in the research area use chemicals, which seems to be related to most households engaged in the production of naranjilla, a citrus fruit that requires high amounts of pesticides to prosper in the Amazon. Expenditure on chemicals is principally driven by wealth, access to credit and land use patterns, with households with more land in crops spending more on fertilizers and pesticides. An important finding is that households receiving money from government social programs spend more on both chemical fertilizers and pesticides than non-recipient households. Ethnicity does not play any role in shaping expenditures on both chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Our results reflect that clear, consistent and coordinated policies are necessary to reconcile conservation and rural development in the Amazon, since, at present, ambiguous and even contradictory policies are not effective in achieving that goal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd', 'Chemical fertilizers', '107', 105490, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105490', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104912386&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2021.105490&partnerID=40&md5=0b62192ce436818acd2333ea5813945a', '2-s2.0-85104912386', 5),

Energy-industry investments might serve as a potential driver of economic performance, indirectly inducing environmental sustainability through investments in the energy-industry transition from old technology to a renewable one. This research provides an empirical assessment of the causal bond between energy-industry investment and economic performance across the regional development levels, employing a dynamic longitudinal data modeling on China\'s 27 provincial and municipality units from 1997 through 2017. It developed an economic performance model to incorporate energy-industry investment as an aggregate production growth input. The core empirical findings are as follows. Firstly, the energy-industry investment and economic performance induced a positive and statistically significant mutual influence, manifested from their parameter estimates. Secondly, a bilateral causal bond is unveiled between energy-industry investment and economic performance based on the Dumitrescu-Hurlin technique, confirming the feedback hypothesis of a causal bond between the two variables.

This study aimed to create a market segmentation based on ecotourism motivations for protected areas on islands. Data were collected through a questionnaire given to 822 tourists on the Galapagos Islands, a province of Ecuador. The Galapagos Archipelago is located in the Pacific Ocean and has been declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2019). It is of volcanic origin surrounded by marine currents. It is made up of two protected areas: Galapagos National Park, which covers the land surface, and the Galapagos Marine Reserve, which protects the marine environment. The findings were later evaluated with a factor analysis and a K-means clustering method. The results showed that there are six motivational dimensions, labeled: self-development, interpersonal relationships and ego-defensive function, escape, building personal relationships, nature appreciation, and reward. Three groups of tourists were identified. The first, the reward and escape group, had high motivations related to nature, experiencing new things, exploring the unknown, fun, escaping the routine, and destressing. The second, multiple motives tourists, scored highly on all motivational variables. Finally, nature tourists had high motivation in aspects related to nature. These results offer a basis for tourism service providers to develop specific products adapted to various tourist motivations, to improve offers adapted to tourist expectations, to increase satisfaction and tourist return rate, and ultimately to benefit the economy of marine protected areas and national parks with higher employment and income.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations establish 17 objectives that guide public policies within countries. The achievement of the SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG12, SDG14 and SDG15 goals, which are totally or partially related to environmental quality, depends mainly on the ability to generate new processes and industrial products friendly to the environment. Innovation arising from research and development (R&D) can be decisive in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. The objective of this research is to examine the effect of R&D on environmental degradation as measured by ecological footprint and air quality, including the role of agriculture and trade. The theoretical framework that supports the methodological strategy is the environmental Kuznets curve. To capture the role of geography, we used the World Bank classification of regions. Using second-generation cointegration techniques and panel data for 77 countries during 1996–2016, we found a cointegration relationship between R&D and environmental degradation, agriculture, and trade. The results of the FMOLS model suggest a heterogeneous impact of research and development on environmental degradation.

This impact will focus on the electricity production levels of each of the OHPS components according to the increase of the fuel price and the SPS size. The Bellavista community in Ecuador was selected as the case study for this work. In this South American country, the government has begun a gradual increase in the diesel fuel price until it reaches international prices. Fifteen scenarios of OHPSs were simulated, in Homer Pro software, considering three SPS sizes and varying the diesel fuel price in five values. The annual load profile for the simulations was built based on the information of a previous study in this community. The results showed that for lower fuel prices (USD$0.26/L and USD$0.35/L), the OHPSs worked mostly with their diesel generators with reduced use of their BESSs.

Our paper is based on a desktop research combined with stakeholder workshops and expert interviews. Overall, both countries made considerable progress in regard to disaster preparedness and monitoring. However, multi-risks are rarely considered and there is still increasing vulnerability due to the expansion of informal settlements. The risk management is characterized by an imbalanced distribution of financial resources and institutional capacities between the metropolitan regions and smaller municipalities, and by low public participation and hardly community-based approaches.

Evidence for OECD countries', '2021', 'The false hope that economic development would lead to a decrease in fossil sources’ energy consumption can be an obstacle to fighting global warming. Is it realistic to expect that more knowledge will lead public policymakers to take more decisive action to mitigate climate change\'s adverse effects? This research attempts to answer both premises using data for developed countries with high human capital levels: 27-member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-OECD during 1980–2015. Access to energy and that it is non-polluting is raised as a goal of the Sustainable Development Goals. We combine linear and non-linear models: we specifically employ threshold regressions and second-generation cointegration techniques, FMOLS, and causality. Our results are disappointing for the first premise: economic development does not reduce energy consumption from fossil sources. However, human capital does decrease the consumption of non-renewable energy. In order to capture current trends in economies, we include the globalization index, the urbanization rate, and services. The results of the cointegration tests suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables.

A set of strategies were developed which can be implemented by public authorities and by community organisations. They were designed from two types of expert consultations: the Delphi method and the analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) combined with Analytic Hierarchy Process method (AHP) for hierarchizing the criteria collected and obtaining strategies. The proposed strategies are as follows: adopting appropriate legal frameworks, respecting peoples’ rights, better distribution of public resources, implementing monitoring systems, developing solidarity markets and recognizing the participation of the poor as a subject of rights. This investigation revealed differences between the state, which identifies the poor with monetary indicators, and the indigenous peoples, who see it as the lack of community links, by conceiving the poor as a beneficiary of official assistance, despite the fact that a strong community and peasant organisation could be used. The value of an economy based on reciprocity and confidence was also recognized, identifying niches of production and consumption to create partnerships and ensure the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making areas. © 2021 by the authors.

The data panel includes 5328 observations from 30 emerging countries covering the period 2014 to 2019. Our results indicate that firms with higher carbon emissions have higher COE, which implies that capital providers penalize highly polluting firms. Contrarily, evidence shows that firms with greater environmental disclosures, and the those who externally assure their corporate social responsibility reports decrease their COE. Our study expands the literature regarding carbon emissions and its relation with firms’ COE from an emerging market perspective covering a multi-country sample, with findings that confirm that higher emitters are penalized in terms of COE. Moreover, our research confirms in this setting the negative relation between environmental, social and governance disclosure scores and COE. Moreover, we evidence as well that the assurance of sustainability reports also promotes legitimacy and decreases information asymmetries, in the sense of reducing COE.

We carried out a study in the rural parishes of the Metropolitan District of Quito (MDQ), Ecuador. The objective of the study was to assess how biophysical factors, institutional capacity and institutional complexity influence the perceived effectiveness of forest and water management. Ordinal logistic regressions were applied and spatial lag regressions were also calculated to assess the possible spatial correlation of the dependent variables. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation analyses (Gi* and Anselin Local Moran´s I) were applied to assess the perceived effectiveness. The regressions results show that the number of stakeholders involved in the management of each resource, used as a proxy for institutional complexity, was a significant variable (p-value = 0.003 for forest resource management and p-value = 0.027 for water resource management) when explaining perceived effectiveness. The spatial autocorrelation results show spatial hotspots (90% and 99% confidence) and a cluster (95 % confidence) of forest management effectiveness as well as some spatial outliers (95% confidence) of water and forest management effectiveness. These findings were put in context to assess the current institutional arrangements used by local actors to implement SDGs 6 and 15.

In light of this, the current study explores which organizational capabilities and factors foster employees’ positive attitudes toward CSR. Past research shows that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) positively influences CSR effectiveness. We hypothesize that the organizational capabilities of frugality and polychronicity and the organizational factors of servant leadership and job satisfaction facilitate OCB. To test the proposed model, we collected data from a sample of 246 frontline employees across different industries. We rely on structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Findings suggest that firms should develop organizational values and managerial processes oriented to cautiously administer resources, practice corporate frugality, and develop polychronicity as core factors to cultivate OCB. These practices support positive attitudes toward CSR programs among frontline employees. The proposed moderating effects of managers’ servant leadership and employees’ job satisfaction receive support from the analysis.

Thus, this study aimed at verifying if there was knowledge construction in social networks through user interactions by using 1,083 comments posted by the audience. Comments were coded according to validated frameworks for language taxonomy and collaborative knowledge construction. Results show that the predominant interaction is that in which viewers pose questions to speakers. Our analyses also revealed that attendees hardly reached the highest levels of knowledge construction through unguided interaction. Often, user interactions went beyond emotional expressions towards evaluation and therefore, could reach a higher level of knowledge construction. This study shows that social networks may offer informal spaces for deliberation and collaborative interaction with the potential to support learning if guided properly.

The generalized method of moments is used to avoid endogeneity problems. Findings: The study finds evidence that firms with higher environmental, social and governance activities disclosed by sustainability reports and assured by external providers decrease their cost of equity, especially if they are in an integrated market as MILA. This finding confirms that agency conflicts between firm\'s management and stakeholders diminish with higher CSR transparency, leading to a lower cost of capital.

Recent research suggests that the microbiota affects susceptibility to both respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and gastrointestinal infections (GIIs). In order to optimize global treatment options, it is important to characterize microbiota profiles across different niches and geographic/socioeconomic areas where RTI and GII prevalences are high. Methods. We performed 16S sequencing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 209 Venezuelan Amerindian children aged 6 weeks–59 months who were participating in a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) study. Using random forest models, differential abundance testing, and regression analysis, we determined whether specific bacteria were associated with RTIs or GIIs and variation in PCV13 response. Results. Microbiota compositions differed between children with or without RTIs (P = .018) or GIIs (P = .001). Several species were associated with the absence of infections. Some of these health-associated bacteria are also observed in developed regions, such as Corynebacterium (log2(fold change [FC]) = 3.30 for RTIs and log2(FC) = 1.71 for GIIs), while others are not commonly observed in developed regions, such as Acinetobacter (log2(FC) = 2.82 and log2(FC) = 5.06, respectively). Klebsiella spp. presence was associated with both RTIs (log2(FC) = 5.48) and GIIs (log2(FC) = 7.20). Conclusions. The nasopharyngeal microbiota of rural Venezuelan children included several bacteria that thrive in tropical humid climates. Interestingly, nasopharyngeal microbiota composition not only differed in children with an RTI but also in those with a GII, which suggests a reciprocal interplay between the 2 environments.

Changes are produced very quickly and software systems require evolving at the same velocity, which implies that the decision-making process of software architectures should be (semi-)automated to satisfy changing needs and to avoid wrong decisions. This issue is critical since suboptimal architecture design decisions may lead to high cost and poor software quality. Therefore, systematic and (semi-)automated mechanisms that help software architects during the decision-making process are required. Architectural patterns are one of the most important features of software applications, but the same pattern can be implemented in different ways, leaving to results of different quality. When an application requires to evolve, knowledge extracted from similar applications is useful for driving decisions, since quality pattern implementations can be reproduced in similar applications to improve specific quality attributes. Therefore, clustering methods are especially suitable for classifying similar pattern implementations. In this paper, we apply a novel unsupervised clustering technique, based on the well-known artificial neural network model Self-Organizing Maps, to classify Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern from a quality point of view. Software quality is analyzed by 24 metrics organized into the categories of Count/Size, Maintainability, Duplications, Complexity, and Design Quality. The main goal of this work is twofold: to identify the quality features that establish the similarity of MVC applications without software architect bias, and to classify MVC applications by means of Self-Organizing Maps based on quality metrics. To that end, this work performs an exploratory study by conducting two analyses with a dataset of 87 Java MVC applications characterized by the 24 metrics and two attributes that describe the technology dimension of the application.

Educational innovation proposes the implementation of new approaches or practices that are beneficial and make an impact on individuals or academic communities. The current educational model of many higher education institutions (HEIs) was not designed for this generation of \'digital natives\'. For this reason, HEIs face the challenge of building teaching strategies that generate meaningful educational experiences. This research seeks to address this issue through a systematic mapping that includes empirical research papers from 2015 to 2020 that study innovations in educational practices using mobile devices. A qualitative and quantitative approach was applied using a four-stage research methodology to evidence innovation in higher education. After employing the selected methodology and applying all the exclusion criteria, 27 papers related to the research topic were identified. Mapping was also performed between the corpus of papers and five dimensions on educational innovation (the purpose of learning, the context of learning, the role of the teacher, the role of the learner, and the evidence of the outcome). The findings reveal that the role of the teacher is the dimension that is least analyzed in innovation initiatives, whereas the most analyzed dimension is the purpose of learning.

The solar LCOH was compared with the LCOH generated by a traditional boiler fuelled by bunker. It was observed that LFC technology has an important technical potential to generate industrial process heat, but in Ecuador it is not economically viable in the short term due to fossil fuel subsidies and the high LFC capital cost. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were carried out varying the bunker price, the LFC capital cost and even considering a carbon tax. Results indicate that with a bunker price of 3.2 USD/gal, 40% reduction in the LFC capital cost or with a carbon tax greater than 110 USD/t CO2, LFCs for solar heat industrial process (SHIP) begins to show economic potential in Ecuador.

Serious Games (SGs) are a tool with an immensely positive impact and great success. SGs enable learning and provide entertainment and self-empowerment, which motivates students. The development of an SG consists of complex processes requiring multi-disciplinary knowledge in multiple domains, including knowing the learning domain and adding the appropriate game mechanics to foster high intrinsic motivation and positive player experience that makes the players feel like they are having fun while learning. Otherwise, the game is viewed as boring and not as a fun and engaging activity. Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed. There is an imbalance between experts’ contributions to education and game design specialists for the SG development. Not all the SGs that have been developed have applied appropriate design methodologies that incorporate both the entertainment mechanics and the serious component. To ensure that an SG meets the user’s expectations, it must be designed using an appropriate method.

Based on the Ecuadorian experience, the goal of this study is to analyze the environmental performance of current and forecasted scenarios of electricity generation and supply using life cycle methods, as a basis to discuss the appropriateness of current policy strategies towards a decarbonized future. The environmental impacts of the electricity mix are dominated by the emissions generated by fossil fuels burning during electricity generation. Results show that increasing the share of hydroelectricity decreases the environmental impacts per kWh considerably, but the environmental performance of net electricity generated in the country is also shaped by the growing energy demand for electricity. The global warming potential of net electricity generation is from 12 to 20 times higher by 2050 over 2016 levels for all scenarios. National policies on energy sustainability will not mitigate the Ecuadorian electricity environmental impacts, due to the growing demand for electricity. Moreover, there are risks to the energy security of Ecuador in the future, as fossil resources scarcity is expected, and climate change uncertainties may pose challenges to the future harnessing of hydropower. Targeting GHG reductions must address the challenge of demand reduction.

The results showed that engine-out NOx emissions were positively correlated with vehicle specific power (VSP). The average NOx reductions (deNOx) of the SCR were 82.8%, 91.7%, and 85.5% for SCR-inlet gas temperatures below, within, and above the thermal window of 220–340 °C, respectively. The 92% of the tailpipe NOx peaks appeared under high power (VSP ≥ 10 W kg−1) and an insufficient deNOx level. Urban driving and long downhill sections in rural conditions caused cooling down of the SCR-inlet gas to below 200 °C, where the deNOx efficiency decreased and became dependent on the exhaust mass flow rate. To estimate the NOx benefit and CO₂ penalty via electrical heating of the SCR-inlet exhaust gas, the vehicle, the real driving dynamics, and the heating were simulated in Passenger car and heavy-duty emission model (PHEM). The minimum threshold of 200 °C resulted in the best NOx/CO₂ trade-off, reducing on average 4.7 mg of NOx per gram of CO₂. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd', 'Aftertreatment heating', '181', 115983, NULL, NULL, 1, '10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115983', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091644134&doi=10.1016%2fj.applthermaleng.2020.115983&partnerID=40&md5=6c0fb7f0a2cc4be69879e17d67eb33c5', '2-s2.0-85091644134', 73),

In the last 3 decades, the Caribbean region has undergone frequent and intense heat waves, storms, floods, and droughts. This has had a detrimental impact on population health and well-being, including an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. Recent advances in climate science have enhanced our ability to anticipate hydrometeorological hazards and associated public health challenges. Here, we discuss progress towards bridging the gap between climate science and public health decision-making in the Caribbean to build health system resilience to extreme climatic events. We focus on the development of climate services to help manage mosquito-transmitted disease epidemics. There are numerous areas of ongoing biological research aimed at better understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we emphasise additional factors that affect our ability to operationalise this biological understanding. We highlight a lack of financial resources, technical expertise, data sharing, and formalised partnerships between climate and health communities as major limiting factors to developing sustainable climate services for health. Recommendations include investing in integrated climate, health and mosquito surveillance systems, building regional and local human resource capacities, and designing national and regional cross-sectoral policies and national action plans. This will contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and maximising regional development partnerships and co-benefits for improved health and well-being in the Caribbean. © 2020 Lowe et al.

Objective: To compare improvement of health and development of children 0–3 years between intervention communities (IC) and control communities (CC) from peripheral settlements of Lima. Sequential interventions included: (1) home and community gardens, (2) conscious nutrition, and (3) parenting workshops following the International Child Development Program (ICDP). Methods: Interventions were delivered by community health promoters (CHPs) using a “step-by-step” learning system. Both IC and CC were monitored before the interventions began, at 8 and 12 months (n = 113 IC and 127 CC children). Data were collected on household characteristics, diet, food security, health indicators (history of diarrhea and respiratory infections, hemoglobin, intestinal parasites, anthropometry), caregiver-child interactions and stress, and achievement of Pan-American Health Organization age-specific developmental milestones. Stepwise multiple logistic regressions were used to determine if the interventions affected food insecurity, as well as motor, social/cognitive and language delays. Results: At baseline, 2.6% were categorized as “suspected developmental delay” and 14.2% were on “alert for development delay.” Food insecurity, diarrhea and respiratory infections were lowered following the interventions. Through the “step-by-step” approach, caregivers in IC gained skills in gardening, conscious nutrition and parenting that reduced the risk of food insecurity [Adjusted Risk Ratio = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08–0.51)] and language delay [0.39 (0.19–0.82)] but not motor or social/cognitive delay.

In tropical climates, an increased UHI intensity can cause a significant rise in heat stress probability, both indoors and outdoors. A general increase in the air-conditioning energy consumption of buildings should also be expected as a consequence. This paper evaluates the case of Duran, Ecuador. It estimated, through a spatial distribution analysis, urban morphology parameters, properties of materials, and anthropogenic heat emissions in the streets. Twenty-eight urban, randomly selected samples were classified using the k-means clustering technique, which resulted in four preliminary clusters. Exploratory UHI simulations were carried out in the Urban Weather Generator tool (UWG) using the four clusters to investigate the relevance of the main UHI driving factors through a sensitivity analysis. Urban samples were weighted, considering the sensitivity analysis, for better classifying the driving factors. Results indicate that Duran city is strongly affected by UHI, especially in informal settlements with high anthropogenic heat release. The urban temperatures obtained by the model were compared to the experimental measurements in different locations in the city. Besides, the building cooling needs were simulated by using the TRNSYS v. 17 tool for residential and commercial buildings of the city, showing that UHI is increasing cooling-related energy consumption in a 30–70 % for residential buildings and a 10–20 % for commercial buildings.

Despite the numerous resources vested in water management, programs have yet to achieve measurable improvements in water quality. To identify the governance mechanisms and barriers to improving water quality, we applied a two-pronged strategy: a collaborative, bottom-up compilation and prioritization of technical specialists and stakeholders’ concerns, and an evaluation of top-down government plans. The comparison of priorities and programs shows four major themes that require attention: barriers to better governance, community involvement, research, and policy. The islands lack a transparent method for accountability of the funds designated for water management, the efficacy of implementation, and results and progress beyond government periods. Government projects have included limited public participation, resulting in projects that do not meet stakeholder’s needs and concerns. Furthermore, the majority of the programs have not been completed within the timeline or budgets allocated. We recommend implementing a participatory governance mechanism that responds to each island’s context, balances socioecological and policy priorities and evaluates past projects to have adequate benchmarking, mitigating a planning fallacy. All programs should be accompanied by a transparent monitoring system that ensures accountability and evaluates water quality programs’ efficiency and effectiveness, according to goals and indicators developed collaboratively. This research may aid practitioners in small island developing states (SIDS) around the globe that are struggling with similar water management and governance issues and who may benefit from taking a bottom-up and top-down approach to assessing technical specialists’ and local stakeholders’ concerns in relation to past, present and future government programs. © 2020 by the authors.

It was the most important fishery in the Galápagos in the early 2000s until overfishing led to its collapse and a 5-year total fishing ban was established (2016–2021) to try to recover it. The management of I. fuscus in the Galápagos has always considered the population density as an indicator for decision-making. The objective of this study is to review the density as an indicator of the population status of I. fuscus using a stock-production model incorporating covariates methodology. For the first time, population and fishing parameters (K, r, and q), reference points (MSY, BMSY, FMSY, and DMSY) and indicators (B/BMSY and F/FMSY) were estimated for I. fuscus. The results indicate that the management measures have not prevented the overexploitation of this species for more than a decade. The goal of the I. fuscus management plan in the Galápagos, i.e., the recovering the fishery in a non-fishing scenario, will not be met by 2030. To accomplish its recovery six recommendations are proposed, including to extend the total ban of the fishery and to change the current management indicators to B/BMSY and F/FMSY.

Cogeneration has been identified as a key strategy for increasing energy generation capacity, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and improving energy efficiency in industry, one of the most energy-demanding sectors worldwide. However, more studies are necessary to define approaches for implementing cogeneration, particularly in countries with tropical climates (such as Ecuador). In Ecuador, the National Plan of Energy Efficiency includes cogeneration as one of the four routes for making energy use more sustainable in the industrial sector. The objective of this paper is two-fold: (1) to identify the potential of cogeneration in the Ecuadorian industry, and (2) to show the positive impacts of cogeneration on power generation capacity, GHG emissions reduction, energy efficiency, and the economy of the country. The study uses methodologies from works in specific types of industrial processes and puts them together to evaluate the potential and analyze the impacts of cogeneration at national level. The potential of cogeneration in Ecuador is ~600 MWel, which is 12% of Ecuador’s electricity generation capacity. This potential could save ~18.6 × 106 L/month of oil-derived fuels, avoiding up to 576,800 tCO2/year, and creating around 2600 direct jobs.

Nevertheless, in Latin America, plastics governance is still fragmented across borders because of dispersed normative adoption and limited regional coordination. In this context, the instrumental level of articulation between the international principles of environmental law and the formal legal arrangements from the Pacific Alliance countries is assessed to analyze how this strategic platform can contribute to offering a regional response to the global problem of single use plastics. For this purpose, an illustrative case study of the national and subnational regulation developed by the Pacific Alliance and its members was performed. To this end, a framework analysis was conducted on the official legal documents from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The results show extensive and scattered subnational regulation to control the consumption of plastic bags and single use plastics, with diverse policies on extended producer responsibility, educational and economic strategies to influence mainly the consumer’s behaviour.

Design/methodology/approach: Empirical data from 152 coffee farmers were analyzed via confirmatory factor analysis and partial least square multi-variate statistics. Findings: Findings highlight, first, that farmers\' proactiveness significantly drives their product innovation and, to a lesser extent, process innovation. This effect holds when considering key control variables, such as access to key resources and associated actors. Second, more surprisingly, farmers\' innovativeness hampers market innovation. Third, entrepreneurial intentions per se did not play a significant role in farmers\' innovation. Fourth, the adapted measurement of risk-taking from the Western literature did not suit well the Ugandan coffee farming context. Research limitations/implications: These results lead to methodological implications for the measurement of farmers\' risk-taking, innovative and proactive attitudes, as well as market innovation in rural Africa. Furthermore, they expand the role farmers\' entrepreneurial orientation on product, process and market innovation in a rural African context. Originality/value: Multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) are often claimed to play an important role in stimulating farmers\' innovation and enhancing rural development. Nevertheless, little is known yet on if why some farmers participating in MSPs may innovate more than others. This paper addresses this gap by shedding light on the role of farmers\' entrepreneurial orientation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.', 'Agricultural innovation', '10', NULL, 629, 650, 3, '10.1108/JADEE-01-2020-0007', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086788069&doi=10.1108%2fJADEE-01-2020-0007&partnerID=40&md5=ef4de0a38eec566d3b301da6dc9c2969', '2-s2.0-85086788069', 94);

By applying the landscape approach to the case study of the rural system of the Spanish-Portuguese border, declared Meseta Ibérica TBR (MITBR), it is verified that the spatial zoning of TBRs is a prominent factor in this gap, since they do not correspond to the landscape units and bioregions.

The use of renewable energy sources increases energy security and enables countries to achieve their climate mitigation goals. Ecuador’s energy mix is dominated using fossil fuels and produces only 7.8% of its energy supply from renewable energy. The scenario analysis suggests that using the example of international renewable energy policies will achieve sustainable energy development in Ecuador. Relying less on fossil fuels and decentralizing the electricity sector from the use of thermoelectric plants is the great challenge for the country. Using the enormous water potential that Ecuador has and taking advantage of the sources of solar, biomass and wind energy available in the country will reduce the forecast of 60,233.70 KT CO2 by 2030 that would be reached if current consumption conditions and energy mix are maintained, while designing a long-term energy planning with a greater participation of renewable energies would forecast a CO2 emission of 41,232.30 KT, that is, a reduction of 31.5% in emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

The NEZ systems were applied to sandy (acid) and clayey (basic) soils from Mediterranean agricultural areas (Spain). Some plant growth indicators were measured: evapotranspiration, plant moisture content, plant biomass, root/shoot ratio, nitrogen and phosphorous uptake and the C/N ratio. The experimental data exhibited differences in the growth indicators for un-amended and amended soils. The addition of the NEZ system increase the plant water content of sunflowers grown on clay soils. The plant biomass of sunflower was improved by the incorporation of NEZ system in all treatments for the two soils studied. A reduction of the root/shoot ratio for the treatments of clay soil by application of NEZ systems were observed. The content of ammonium and phosphorous in tissues increased considerably with the addition of amendment material. Besides, the ammonium, nitrate and inorganic phosphorous in the post-test soils revealed that nutrients were still available for a second growth cycle. As demonstrated in previous work, the NEZ system releases nutrients continuously controlled by soil pH and mineral composition as well as the irrigation conditions provided. Therefore, this approach of amendment materials for soil seems to be a promising alternative for agricultural practice, where the dose selection must be balanced according to the plant\'s nutrient needs and soil properties by adjusting the growth conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.', 'Amended soil', '727', 138646, NULL, NULL, 4, '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138646', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083458951&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.138646&partnerID=40&md5=ea1ec23a36aea397dce2ec2f1db5c340', '2-s2.0-85083458951', 114),

A survey in situ on a random sample of 3200 students was done in 2019. By using multivariate methods, an organizational typology was built. Next, CM were related to the level of student satisfaction by general linear model (GLM). Twenty-three organizational variables were grouped into six components that explained 66.23% of the variance. A typology with three groups was built: Cluster 1 with a moderate CM level (44.57% of the sample), Cluster 2 with a low level of CM (38.18%), and Cluster 3 with a high level of CM (15.25%). By GLM, a positive relation between typology and students’ levels of satisfaction was found. Therefore, an increase of CM turned into a major satisfaction level at UTEQ. We suggest, as a priority, to improve communication amongst students and administrative staff. Communication should be frequent, accurate, on time, and oriented to solve problems. It would also be positive to increase the CM amongst students and representatives in solving communication problems, sharing knowledge, goals, and mutual respect. © 2020 by the authors.

Our results showed that the municipal water treatment plants generally produced high quality drinking water but detection of Escherichia coli in 2–30% of post-treatment distribution samples suggests contamination and/or regrowth during distribution and storage. Linear regression revealed a modest, negative relationship between residual chlorine and microbial concentrations in drinking water samples, while 24-h antecedent rainfall only slightly increased microbial counts. Taken together, our results underscore the challenge of providing a safely managed drinking water source where limited freshwater quantities result in intermittent flow and require storage at the household level.

The full scale of social inequalities in health has been hidden by the lack of reliable data. This study aimed to measure and compare health inequalities in the working population within and between 15 countries of LAC. Methods: A sample of 180,163 workers aged 18 years and older was drawn from the most recent national surveys of working conditions or health in 15 LAC countries. Poor self-perceived health (P-SPH) was used as a health indicator, and age, education level, and occupational category as inequality stratifiers. We calculated four measures: absolute and relative population-attributable risks, the Kuznets and weighted Keppel indexes. Results: P-SPH prevalence ranged from 9% in men from Uruguay to 50% in women from Nicaragua. It was higher in women than in men in most countries. A clear gradient was shown, in which young people in non-manual skilled jobs and high education had the lowest prevalence. Nearly 45% of cases that reported P-SPH among men and 35% among women could be avoided if all the groups received a higher level of education. Also, approximately 42% of P-SPH reported by men and 31% by women could be avoided if they all shared the working and employment conditions of non-manual skilled jobs. Conclusions: Wide health inequalities were found between occupational and educational groups in LAC. However, country borders appear to be an even more important stratifier in the production of health inequalities. Urgent interventions to improve worker\'s health are needed in countries where prevalence of poor self-perceived health is high.

The study relies on in-depth interviews, case studies and an interpretative approach to unpick the dynamics of product differentiation by families in business dedicated to producing specialty coffee. Findings: The findings show that product differentiation in specialty coffee family farms is influenced by both business and family aspects and driven by entrepreneurial stewards. Coffee-farming families can engage in product differentiation through a shared vision, a combination of traditional and specialised knowledge, and through the continuous development of an exchange network. The findings reveal a connection between families in business balancing family and business interests, and the strategic intention to build up their assets entrepreneurially over time.

Increased Cd bioavailability is an acute problem in cacao-based horticulture. Poverty, poor maintenance, unjustified traditional farming, and paucity of knowledge on Cd-binding propensity in cacao discourage the application of risk-mitigation measures. Progressive accumulation of Cd, with a half-life of 10–30 years, in the human body even at ultra-trace levels may lead to serious health complications. If Cd accumulates in the food chain through cocoa products, consequences in children, who are the primary consumers of chocolates, include morbidity and mortality that may result in a significant demographic transition by the year 2050. Developing cacao clones with an innate capability of taking up low Cd levels from soils, and site-specific Cd-cacao research might contribute to limiting the trophic transfer of Cd.

Rapid urban growth and agricultural activities are the main threats to the conservation of its biodiversity. To promote the conservation of natural spaces in urban planning instruments, it is necessary to first demonstrate their environmental and ecological value. In this paper, such value was analyzed by quantifying biodiversity value and carbon storage capacity in situ. The results show that Puyo\'s periphery (a 4 km radius) is an opportunity space, where the conservation of its biodiversity is a key factor in strategies to promote sustainable urban development. Firstly, there are natural areas of high environmental value (secondary forest, gramalote pastures with trees and gramalote pastures) that all together fix 1,664,683 Mg CO2 and control hydrological risks (with 80% of the green areas linked to flood areas)-valuable ecosystem services. Secondly, the conservation of biodiversity brings associated economic activities that can promote local sustainable development.

First, a key distinctive organizational feature of MSPs relative to other novel organizational forms in emerging economies entails the presence of a virtual and/or physical interface spanning across multiple heterogeneous stakeholders.

We found that the solicitation process, which yielded 180 applications, fell short of its goal of attracting applicants well distributed among the Andean countries, applications from women, and applications for interdisciplinary transformative research projects. Nevertheless, the 15 projects that were funded did ultimately cross disciplinary lines, result in diverse outputs and outcomes, and help to advance work toward achieving sustainable development and biodiversity conservation in the Andean forest landscape.

The loss of their important environmental services has prompted calls to integrate ecosystem services (ES) in addition to socio-economic objectives in decision-making. To test the effect of accounting for both ES and socio-economic objectives in land-use decisions, we develop a new dynamic approach to model deforestation scenarios for tropical mountain forests. We integrate multi-objective optimization of land allocation with an innovative approach to consider uncertainty spaces for each objective. These uncertainty spaces account for potential variability among decision-makers, who may have different expectations about the future. When optimizing only socio-economic objectives, the model continues the past trend in deforestation (1975–2015) in the projected land-use allocation (2015–2070). Based on indicators for biomass production, carbon storage, climate and water regulation, and soil quality, we show that considering multiple ES in addition to the socio-economic objectives has heterogeneous effects on land-use allocation. It saves some natural forest if the natural forest share is below 38%, and can stop deforestation once the natural forest share drops below 10%. For landscapes with high shares of forest (38%–80% in our study), accounting for multiple ES under high uncertainty of their indicators may, however, accelerate deforestation. For such multifunctional landscapes, two main effects prevail: (a) accelerated expansion of diversified non-natural areas to elevate the levels of the indicators and (b) increased landscape diversification to maintain multiple ES, reducing the proportion of natural forest.

In 2017, a follow-up survey was administered (N = 202) and a subset of 84 household water samples were tested for chlorine residual levels and microbial contamination. From 2005 to 2017, access to a household water connection increased from 19.4% to 90.3%. However, reliability decreased over time, as in the latter half of 2009, households had access to piped water 79% of the time, compared to 63% by 2017. Piped water samples were highly contaminated with total coliforms (100% of samples) and Escherichia coli (89% of samples). From 2005 to 2017, households less likely to report drinking water treatment (50.6%–5.0%). And from 2009 to 2017, bottled water was increasingly consumed as the primary drinking water source (18.8%–62.4%). From 2005 to 2012, having a household connection was not statistically significantly associated with diarrhea case status (OR: 0.86 95%CI: 0.53, 1.39). Neither household water treatment nor bottled water consumption were negatively associated with diarrhea. Increased water storage was associated with diarrhea (OR: 1.33 per 10L of water stored, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.69).

Accurate ecosystem distribution maps are required to assess representation of ecosystems in protected areas, but standardized, high spatial resolution, and globally comprehensive ecosystem maps have heretofore been lacking. While macroscale global ecoregions maps have been used in global conservation priority setting exercises, they do not identify distinct localized ecosystems at the occurrence (patch) level, and instead describe large ecologically meaningful areas within which additional conservation planning and management are necessary.

The politics of transnational community forestry networks in Mesoamerica and the Congo Basin', '2020', 'Since the 1990s, forest-dependent communities in tropical regions have created national and transnational grassroots networks. While in Latin America, their main goal is to promote community forestry and claim territorial rights, forest-dependent communities in the Congo Basin are more focused on improving participatory inclusion in forest policies. These diverging trends are rooted in the historical social movements’ struggles in Latin America and in the international actors’ push for more inclusion of local communities by governments in Central Africa. Given that the emergence of transnational community forestry networks is linked to different claims of autonomy based on regional context, how do the politics of autonomy driven by transnational grassroots networks influence community forest governance? This paper aims to examine how the different types of autonomy claimed by transnational grassroots networks, – vis-à-vis state bureaucracies, international partners and community organisations, – affect the multi-scale governance of community forestry in tropical regions.

Mollusks, the second largest metazoan phylum in terms of species richness, are no exception to this pattern, but, to date, a comprehensive synthesis of non-native mollusk species (NNMS) in South America was not available. For this purpose, an e-discussion group was formed with malacologists and taxonomists from South America, where we exchanged and analyzed bibliography, databases and information about NNMS, providing expert opinion to this assessment. The first list of non-native mollusk species for South America, considering terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments, includes 86 NNMS distributed in 152 ecoregions (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) of the 189 recognized for the South American continent. Information on their native region, vectors, first record for South America and distribution, are also provided. In the analysis of the distribution of the NNMS and the entry points of each species (e.g., ports, cargo and passenger airports, cities) and status of conservation of the ecoregions, four hot spots were recognized: Subtropical-Atlantic, Northern Andes, Central Andes and Southern Andes.

The modelling procedure was challenging but doable, and even the first model version showed better performance than traditional gridded global models of river flow. We used the open-source code of the HYPE model and applied it for >130 000 catchments (with an average resolution of 1000 km2), delineated to cover the Earth\'s landmass (except Antarctica). The catchments were characterized using 20 open databases on physiographical variables, to account for spatial and temporal variability of the global freshwater resources, based on exchange with the atmosphere (e.g. precipitation and evapotranspiration) and related budgets in all compartments of the land (e.g. soil, rivers, lakes, glaciers, and floodplains), including water stocks, residence times, and the pathways between various compartments.

This paper presents a spatial-temporal growth model for estimating the adoption of new end-use electric technologies encouraged by energy-efficiency policies. The proposed method consists of three modules: temporal, spatial and grouping. The temporal module calculates by districts or census tracts of a city, the percentage of homes in which residents are prospective buyers of a new end-use electric technology. Then, the spatial module adjusts the calculations made by the temporal module, considering the spatial interactions among the inhabitants of the districts. Finally, the grouping module discovers the low-voltage transformer where the prospective buyers are connected. The results of the proposed model are a spatial database with information related to the percentage of homes in which residents are prospective buyers of a new end-use electric technology, as well as the number of prospective buyers connected to each low-voltage transformer. The results can visualize through thematic maps to identify the districts where the new technology will have faster adoption. The proposed method was employed to estimate the adoption of induction heating cookers in a medium-sized Ecuadorian city. The Ecuadorian government has developed a program of economic subsidies to encourage its population to use this electrical appliance. The results from this application are an important tool to estimate the spatial increase in electricity demand, decide important issues related to the planning of distributed resources, and develop demand-side management programs.

The measurement instrument used was that developed by Mayfield, Mayfield, & Kopf (1995), the seven-point Likert scale was used. The participants were 255 employees from the administrative area of​ public and private companies located in Guayaquil, Posorja and Milagro cities located in Ecuador. The measurement instrument for motivating language was adjusted to the studied population with seventeen observable variables. To analyze the decision-making variable, studies related to communication were selected from literature review to establish an association of qualities. In conclusion, it was shown that motivating language contributes to a favorable organizational climate for decision-making for both leaders and employees. Empathetic language predominated as the most effective form of communication from leaders. © 2020, Universidad del Zulia.

For decades, Ecuador has invested heavily in consumption subsidies for liquified petroleum gas (LPG), a leading clean fuel. With the goal of understanding household energy use in a context where LPG is ubiquitous and cheap, we administered 808 household surveys in peri-urban and rural communities in coastal and Andean Ecuadorian provinces. We assess cooking fuel ownership and use patterns after long-term LPG access and the reach of induction stoves promoted through a recent government program. Nearly all participants reported using LPG for more than a decade and frequent, convenient access to highly subsidized LPG. Nonetheless, half of rural households and 20% of peri-urban households rely on firewood for cooking and to meet specific household energy needs, like space heating or heating water for bathing. Induction was rare and many induction owners reported zero use because the required equipment had never been installed by electricity companies, their stove had broken, or due to fears of high electricity costs. Our discussion is instructive for other countries because of Ecuador\'s long-standing clean fuel policies, robust LPG market and standardized cylinder recirculation model, and promotion of induction stoves. © 2019', 'Biomass cooking', '136', 111053, NULL, NULL, 10, '10.1016/j.enpol.2019.111053', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074329788&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2019.111053&partnerID=40&md5=f496af6919cacc032380354c1cdb265a', '2-s2.0-85074329788', 189),

Our study aims to achieve a better understanding of how Ecuadorian nurses perceive the theoretical advantages and limitations of ICTs, as well as to explore the current use of these technologies in the setting of the professional nursing practice. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey-based cross-sectional study where 191 nurses rated their frequency of use and level of agreement to specific statements on perceptions related to ICTs. For the statistical analyses, adjusted binomial logistic regressions and the chi-squared test for association were applied. Results: In general, 96.3% of nurses reported the use of ICTs to communicate with colleagues, and 80.1% reported the use of ICTs to communicate with patients. More than 70% of participants agreed that ICTs can be useful to promote professional services, help in the search for new job opportunities and/or professional development, foster health promotion, and improve the workflow with colleagues. Meanwhile, 78.6% of nurses had privacy or security concerns about personal and/or patient information, and 60.6% reported not having enough time neither to learn how to use ICTs nor to use them. Conclusion: High use of ICTs was found among Ecuadorian nurses for communicating with both colleagues and patients.

The present analysis was carried out using a comparative approach to estimate the frequency of use and the perceived capacity of the flow of cultural services in the view of local communities and tourists of the Chimborazo Wildlife Production Reserve, Ecuador. Based on 356 valid questionnaires for locals and 250 questionnaires for tourists, 208 of which were applied to nationals and 42 to foreigners, the results indicate that respondents tend to use and place value on cultural services provided by Chimborazo Mountain. The frequency of use seems to be related to proximity and local beliefs in the case of locals, and to the knowledge of tourism activities in the case of tourists. Out of the 10 selected tourist attractions, Chimborazo volcano with the surrounding patches of natural forest was perceived to hold the capacity to ensure the flow of cultural services for both locals and tourists.

A non-random sample of 1429 employees was used who had been working at least one year in the current company. The sample, composed of workers from different industries, was collected in postgraduate programs of business schools from seven Latin American countries. A multi-group structural equation model was built with the involved variables, which adopted two different conditions: i.e., unconstrained and constrained questionnaire measurement weights. According to the results, leadership by itself is insufficient to promote employees innovative work behaviour. Transformational and transactional leadership exert effect on this behaviour only through absorptive capacity and work engagement respectively. Likewise, absorptive capacity and employee work engagement show direct effects on innovative work behaviour. Additionally, organizational climate for innovation shows a significant moderating effect on the all relationships included in the model. Despite the cultural differences, the two-condition model yielded the same effect in each country, which indicates the validity of a general model of innovative work behaviour for the whole region supporting the common identity of this region.

The current effects demand effective climate actions which were set out in the Paris Agreement with the global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the main changes to face and mitigate climate change depend on each countrys decisions and not only on global agreements as the impacts and its magnitudes vary locally. One of the key components for an effective adaption and mitigation is the role that the behavior of the population may have over national politics and subsequent decisions. For this reason, the level of awareness and knowledge about climate change is vital. The objective of the current study was to compare the perception of Ecuadorian academics regarding global and national climate change with the scientific evidence and historical facts, and how it may affect their vulnerability to the climate change effects. The results show that Ecuadorian academics are well aware of globally known facts of climate change such as existence, gravity and responsibility of humans. However, there is limited awareness about the origin, since 67.2% believes that this is the first climate change in human history.

Such knowledge can be the result of scientific investigation, but important insight can also reside in observant local land managers. In seasonally dry tropical forests in southern Ecuador, recent decades have seen important advances in the knowledge of the biodiversity values of these forests, but the available data have not yet been integrated and translated into tools that support managers in deciding restoration measures. One powerful framework to organize and communicate information about ecosystem degradation and recovery dynamics is the state-transition model. We generated such a model by combining ecologist and local knowledge obtained through an adaptation of the Stanford/SRI expert elicitation protocol. Through this information, we identified five forest states with specific attributes of vegetation, human pressures, and restoration needs. Ecologists and locals agreed on the restoration actions but partially disagreed on the causes of degradation. Whereas ecologists considered that grazing management, often introduced with or after logging, was the catalyst for a transition to degraded states, locals attributed those transitions to the effects of logging alone.

Yet, forest patches do occur in the tropics where a single tree species is dominant. Such “monodominant” forests are known from all of the main tropical regions. For Amazonia, we sampled the occurrence of monodominance in a massive, basin-wide database of forest-inventory plots from the Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN). Utilizing a simple defining metric of at least half of the trees ≥ 10 cm diameter belonging to one species, we found only a few occurrences of monodominance in Amazonia, and the phenomenon was not significantly linked to previously hypothesized life history traits such wood density, seed mass, ectomycorrhizal associations, or Rhizobium nodulation. In our analysis, coppicing (the formation of sprouts at the base of the tree or on roots) was the only trait significantly linked to monodominance. While at specific locales coppicing or ectomycorrhizal associations may confer a considerable advantage to a tree species and lead to its monodominance, very few species have these traits. Mining of the ATDN dataset suggests that monodominance is quite rare in Amazonia, and may be linked primarily to edaphic factors. © 2019, The Author(s).', NULL, '9', 13822, NULL, NULL, 13, '10.1038/s41598-019-50323-9', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072673047&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-50323-9&partnerID=40&md5=f0bfce32918329a5bcc36aae24abc6bc', '2-s2.0-85072673047', 200),

This study employs an original approach that operationalises SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture). This tool was chosen for the analysis because of the wide spectrum of sustainability issues considered in the evaluation, along with the fact that it is easy for producers and decision makers to implement and understand, and offers the consequential possibility to identify precise measures to enhance sustainability in the short term. Results show that organic and Fairtrade farms achieve more sustainable performance than those of conventional farms in terms of governance, environmental and economic dimensions. Nevertheless, conventional farms display better outcomes in matters of social sustainability. The reason most likely lies in the size and processes of farms rather than their certification standards.

Therefore, according to travel agencies, to directly influence the distribution chain, we verified this work to demonstrate the use of digital language as a benefit in the design of sustainable tourism products. Thus, from the methodological discipline of discourse analysis, we created sets of words with semantic content that were valued through the sentiment scales of the Facebook social media network. The results showed that digital promotion favors airline companies and hostels more than a sustainable tourism environment as such. Finally, from the study of probability and density equations, predictive models were used to configure linguistic icons in promoting sustainable tourism. © 2019 by the authors.', 'Essential marketing', '11', 4655, NULL, NULL, 3, '10.3390/su11174655', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071993807&doi=10.3390%2fsu11174655&partnerID=40&md5=e893e758674ca6fc0b175088df45d071', '2-s2.0-85071993807', 217),

We argue that livability assessment can aid the implementation of certain New Urban Agenda (NUA) goals by providing a flexible way to assess urban environments and their quality. However, a reliable and transferable assessment framework requires the key elements of livability to be defined in such a way that measurable factors adequately represent the person-environment relationship. As an innovative approach, we determined key livability elements accordingly and asked over 400 residents worldwide to evaluate their urban environments using these parameters. Thereby, we could calibrate the livability assessment workflow by including personal aspects and identifying the most relevant livability factors through an ordinal regression analysis. Next, we performed relational-statistical learning in order to define the individual and combined contribution of these statistically significant factors to the overall livability of a place. We found that urban form and mobility-related factors tend to have the highest influence on residential satisfaction. Finally, we tested the robustness of the assessment by using geospatial analysis to model the livability for the city of Vienna, Austria. We concluded that the workflow allows for a reliable livability assessment and for further utilization in urban planning, improving urban quality by going beyond simple city rankings. © 2019 by the authors.', 'GIS', '11', 4934, NULL, NULL, 7, '10.3390/su11184934', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072594947&doi=10.3390%2fsu11184934&partnerID=40&md5=7f3e028d2f699bfad8ecb4d53b8ab5f4', '2-s2.0-85072594947', 218),

In 84 of the 91 articles retained for the study, ecological indicators were evaluated, while only seven articles included measurements of socioeconomic indicators.

Brazil was the country in the region where most monitoring was being carried out (51% of the articles), and tropical rainforest (33%) and tropical dry forest (25%) were the ecosystem types where ecological restoration was most frequently monitored. Highly vulnerable ecosystems such as mangroves and paramos were underrepresented. Attributes related to ecosystem stability or to governance and education of communities were not monitored at all.

We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women.

The application of technology in teaching-learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching-learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student\'s performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades.

The problem is conceptual. Modern biorefineries were built around well-optimized, cost-effective chemical synthesis routes, like those used in petroleum refineries for the synthesis of fuels, plastics, and solvents. However, these were designed for the conversion of fossil resources and are far from optimal for the processing of biomass, which has unique chemical characteristics. Accordingly, existing biomass commodities were never intended for modern biorefineries as they were bred to meet the needs of conventional agriculture. In this perspective paper, we propose a new path toward the design of efficient biorefineries, which capitalizes on a cross-disciplinary synergy between plant, physical, and catalysis science. In our view, the best opportunity to advance profitable and sustainable biorefineries requires the parallel development of novel feedstocks, conversion protocols and synthesis routes specifically tailored for total biomass valorization. Above all, we believe that plant biologists and process technologists can jointly explore the natural diversity of plants to synchronously develop both, biobased crops with designer chemistries and compatible conversion protocols that enable maximal biomass valorization with minimum input utilization. By building biorefineries from the bottom-up (i.e., starting with the crop), the envisioned partnership promises to develop cost-effective, biomass-dedicated routes which can be effectively scaled-up to deliver profitable and resource-use efficient biorefineries. © 2019 Torres, Xu, Nikiforidis, Bitter and Trindade.', 'Biobased economy', '10', 478, NULL, NULL, 3, '10.3389/fpls.2019.00478', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067345524&doi=10.3389%2ffpls.2019.00478&partnerID=40&md5=41107ddb34abdd0a83dea323b5769be5', '2-s2.0-85067345524', 234),

It is, however, the source of many environmental problems, including the release of untreated liquid effluents and odorous emissions, and the production and disposal of solid wastes. The main aim of this study was to propose a treatment train for the zootechnical farm wastewater, combining natural systems (i.e., lagoons and subsurface flow beds) with conventional technologies and a cost-benefit analysis. With reference to a specific case study, the different steps of the treatment train were designed and the corresponding construction, operational and maintenance costs evaluated. To better assess the technical and economic feasibility of such a proposal, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out. The social benefit was evaluated by means of the contingent valuation method and a focus on the methodology and collected results was reported. The main findings discussed, in terms of selected treatments, their costs, and the financial and economic analysis of the project, could be useful for administrators, decision-makers and all technicians involved in planning and management of zootechnical farm wastewaters in developing countries, in particular in Latin America. © 2019 by the authors.', 'Constructed wetlands', '11', 779, NULL, NULL, 2, '10.3390/w11040779', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065074428&doi=10.3390%2fw11040779&partnerID=40&md5=ea969e7cccaedb2c8fadf66d8da151b0', '2-s2.0-85065074428', 237),

As a consequence it is crucial to integrate ecosystem services into strategies for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Because insects and other invertebrates have profound and well-identified influences on many ecosystems services (e.g. pollination and biological control) and SDGs (e.g. crop pest and disease vectors), insect research and development have a great potential to address current global challenges. In this commentary we argue that time is ripe to put more efforts in developing integrated research on the ecosystem services provided by insects, as they may result in solutions to achieve many SDGs. We provide evidence of insects’ utility to address global challenges and propose a framework of the needed shift in the perception of insects from enemies and allies, providers of ecosystem services, to solutions to achieve SDGs. We further advocate that making a place for SDG-relevant research on insects’ ecosystem services requires transforming existing academic knowledge into applications-driven science, a potential up-scaling of local solutions and socio-economic relevance.

Although latrines are integral for reducing enteric pathogen transmission, several studies have shown no evidence that latrine ownership improved child health. There are a number of explanations for these results. One explanation is that latrine access does not equate to latrine use. Latrine use, however, is difficult to accurately ascertain, as defecation behavior is often stigmatized. To address this measurement issue, we measure latrine use as a latent variable, indicated by a suite of psychosocial variables. Methods: We administered a survey of 16 defecation-related psychosocial questions to 251 individuals living in rural Ecuador. We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to these data to model the probability of latrine use as a latent variable. To account for uncertainty in predicted latent class membership, we used a pseudo-class approach to impute five different probabilities of latrine use for each respondent. Via regression modeling, we tested the association between household sanitation and each imputed latrine use variable. Results: The optimal model presented strong evidence of two latent classes (entropy = 0.86): consistent users (78%) and inconsistent users (22%), predicted by 5 of our 16 psychosocial variables. There was no evidence of an association between the probability of latrine use, predicted from the LCA, and household access to basic sanitation (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.6-2.1). This suggests that home access to a sanitation facility may not ensure the use of the facility for every family member at all times. Conclusion: Effective implementation and evaluation of sanitation programs requires accurate measurement of latrine use. Psychosocial variables, such as norms, perceptions, and attitudes may provide robust proxy-measures.

The implementation of collaborative governance requires the adoption of supportive regulations, resources, and the development of capable public sector institutions. In recent years, several countries in Latin America have introduced reforms to their water codes to promote collaborative water governance. However, our knowledge of the outcomes of these reforms is still in its infancy, in particular on how they influence the evolution of existing governance initiatives. In this paper, I study how collaborative water governance initiatives in Ecuador responded to the introduction of new regulations for stakeholder participation in watershed councils. Our findings show that network structures respond in different ways to policy change. In a context where regulations limit the participation of NGOs in watershed committees, the network with higher dependency to external resources was incapable of adjusting. On the other hand, the key elements that helped the resilient network navigate policy change were the existence of high levels of trust, the availability of resources to subsidize participation, the ability to connect the local structure to other networks, and high levels of perceived legitimacy. Governments and international donors interested in SDG 6 should consider these elements to design and implement strategies to promote collaborative management in regions where initiatives already exist. Failure to do so may cause weaker structures to disappear, and discourage actors from future participation, increasing the costs of putting collaborative structures in place and leaving inequalities untackled. © 2019 by the author(s).', 'Ecuador', '24', 29, NULL, NULL, 2, '10.5751/ES-10667-240129', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065756826&doi=10.5751%2fES-10667-240129&partnerID=40&md5=fd228b7d5b21745fc229c47b705cbf13', '2-s2.0-85065756826', 252),

Environmental education is introduced, its trajectory and evolution are reviewed in multiple currents, and the predominant one, education for sustainable development, is described, stressing on its implicit conceptions and shortcomings. Then, critical environmental education is presented, which spurns the uniformity of global capitalism and teaches the old and the new roots to our land and to the Earth, and a plural and diverse sense of collective and individual identity. We focus on its proposals in relation to ecologism, criticism, sustainability, interculturality, and participation. Afterwards, we reflect on some specific characteristics that the pedagogical proposal of critical environmental education should have for the construction of global good living.

Although some 75% of all buildings in Europe are energy-inefficient, only 0.4–1.2% of the whole stock is renovated each year. The greatest challenge for the coming decades is to increase the rate, quality and effectiveness of building renovation. The overall goal of the present article is to illustrate the key role to be played by Life Cycle Thinking in sustainable development policies and its implementation in the design of optimal retrofit solutions. The main housing renovation policies implemented in Spain were submitted to analysis using the focus of Life Cycle Approaches. Representative case studies were selected based on the analysis of 3245 real renovation solutions funded by policy programmes in the period between 2010 and 2014. Current solutions were assessed and compared to other retrofit scenarios that a priori might seem more desirable when striving for energy-efficient buildings. Multi-criteria assessment results reveal that the current renovation strategies applied in Madrid and Seville are, by no means optimal solutions, while only a small additional cost could produce significant performance improvement in Bilbao. The Passivhaus standard that offers the greatest reduction of energy consumption in all three cities would appear, however, not to be the solution of choice for any of them. These findings demonstrate the need to integrate Life Cycle thinking into the building process to identify the most sustainable energy pathways. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd', 'Energy', '206', NULL, 267, 281, 15, '10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.173', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054742821&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2018.09.173&partnerID=40&md5=8388f4603ef0245bbf3337b574a72a24', '2-s2.0-85054742821', 257),

(259, 'Sustainable innovation and service quality: An integrated overview', '2019', 'Sustainability is today a main concern of society. One way of addressing the problem and the need for sustainability is through innovation in products and services that are geared towards the satisfaction of specific needs of organizations, institutions or costumers related to a demand for products, services or product-services that are friendlier to the environment. Sustainable innovation is thus seen as a way of meeting the expectations of consumers and organizations regarding the delivery of green products or services. Stated in this way, there are two concepts that emerge as fundamental to the study of sustainability: the concept of sustainable innovation and the concept of service quality. The research questions that motivate this research are: what is the relationship between sustainable innovation and service quality? Are the expectations of consumers or organizations being met by the supply of green products and services? What are the implications in terms of changes that organizations or consumers must make? Having in mind these questions, the aim of this document is to explore the relationship between sustainable innovation and service quality in the scientific literature, identifying the factors and interactions that are suggested by it. The research methodology used to achieve that objective was based on a literature review, made with a qualitative approach. A four-point scale was developed to assess, in each article, the level of relation between the two concepts. The scale ranges from high to null relation between the two concepts. Most of the articles propose a positive relation between the two concepts, whereby 58% of the articles reviewed have the category of \"high relation\", and 31% were categorized as having a \"medium relation\".

Due to the need for communication, portability and ubiquity, several of these methods use mobile devices to achieve their goal. Laptops, smartphones and tablets, with access to wireless networks, can be used to improve teacher–student interaction and thereby stimulate students’ motivation, participation and active learning. Gamification is a teaching-learning strategy, which incorporates knowledge based on games that can support and mostly motivate the work of students and teachers. This document presents the results of a study using the Kahoot Platform, which is a web service of social and gamified education learning, in order to create evaluations changed into games of knowledge and competition among students. When it is used as a questionnaire, it challenges users to answer the questions posed, with a controlled response time, accumulated points, badges and a podium with the first five places. This leads to an active and dynamic learning due to the strong playful component, competitive and teamwork.

In order to encourage more flexible working environments and establish generators of sustainable development for participating countries through an educated society, various international organisations that intervene in the quality dimension within the framework of a systemic approach to Higher Education, including the World Bank, have made multiple efforts to establish various recognitions, certifications and credits pertaining to competency-based education. Materials and Methods. The research, featuring a study of theoretical-interpretative design, was based around the qualitative paradigm. Information was obtained by means of semi-structured interviews with 14 lecturers from different universities in the city of Quito in Ecuador. The data obtained were triangulated with a review of the literature carried out by the researchers. Results. The informants considered cognitive competencies to be the most relevant within the context of teacher formation. Research, planning and organisation skills were not established in importance due to university professionalisation. Additionally, the need to establish curricular changes in the Ecuadorian university pedagogy was confirmed. Discussion and Conclusion. After contrasting the opinions of university professors and formation theories, a theoretical reflection is presented in which the importance of unifying professional formation and investigative competencies is emphasised.

The paper discusses the main components of the project and the solutions adopted to achieve the intended objectives at three different levels: at the technical level, glossaLAB aims at developing a platform for knowledge integration based on the elucidation of concepts, metaphors, theories and problems, including a semantically-operative recompilation of valuable scattered encyclopedic contents devoted to two entangled transdisciplinary fields: the sciences of systems and information. At the theoretical level, the goal is reducing the redundancy of the conceptual system (defined in terms of “intensional performance” of the contents recompiled), and the elucidation of new concepts.

However, long-term climatic changes may affect the role of hydropower in meeting energy and climate policy objectives. The effects of climate change on runoff availability for hydropower generation are largely uncertain. This paper uses climate change scenarios derived from a large ensemble of Global Circulation Models as input for an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) to examine least-cost options for the hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system in the period to 2050. This is done in the context of three policy cases in order to assess trade-offs between power system configuration, emissions and costs. The results show that in the long-term hydropower will remain as one of the most cost-effective and low emission technologies in the Ecuadorian power sector. However, constraints on deployment and uncertainty around climate change impacts could hinder its ability to contribute to the fulfilment of NDC targets, as well as create uncertainty around long-term power system costs.

For these reasons, during the university training process, it is fundamental that students learn skills to work in groups as well as to address problems in multidisciplinary teams. In the light of the above, in this paper, we present an intelligent system that determines the best alternatives to automatically generate groups of students to address practice activities and problems.

Up to date, PCMs are elaborated with raw and expensive materials. Therefore, the main appeal of the PCM is its support material, recycled diatomite, a palm oil industrial waste. PCMs were elaborated with three support materials (raw, recycled, and recycled-calcined diatomite) to compare its influence on PCM thermal and chemical behavior. Different mixtures of organic components (esters of palm oil and commercial stearic acid in different proportions) were incorporated into the three support materials. A characterization process by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to select the organic mixture with the highest value of latent heat of fusion and the closest phase change temperature range to the thermal comfort in each support material. To establish the thermal and chemical stability of the PCMs, DSC, thermogravimetry (TGA), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis were carried out at 0, 120, 240 and 360 thermal cycles. One of the major outcomes from these joint efforts is the good and long thermal and chemical performance of the PCMs composed by 100% of commercial stearic acid methyl esters and recycled-calcined diatomite. This PCM is capable to have a similar energy storage capacity to the PCM supported in raw diatomite.

Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world\'s population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae.

To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. Methods: The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries—Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation.

However, people with disabilities are still excluded from full participation because of the lack of accessibility of OER websites, as well as of the resources themselves. This work presents a proposal for the design of OER websites that would enable equitable access for all users. This design aims to bridge the accessibility gap through the personalization of the whole OER environment to facilitate an accessible User Experience (UX) based on a user profile that includes the self-identification of disability status. This profile configures not only the “look and feel” of the interface but also the delivery of educational resources suitable for this user profile. To achieve this purpose, the design goes beyond compliance with the ISO/IEC 40500 W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, since it includes the personalization of the accessible experience through usability considerations and adaptations of educational resources. The delivery of educational resources matches the user’s profile with regard to their sensory abilities, cognitive faculties and their requirements of functionality control, display layout and language. As a proof of concept, we have developed an OER website based on this design and have conducted a set of UX tests that include users with different disabilities. The test results confirm the feasibility and suitability of our design regarding accessible UX.

Although geothermal energy presents its own particular challenges in comparison with other renewable energy technologies, geothermal energy has showed significant potential to reduce environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production. Advantages of geothermal energy are not only the generation of electricity in different plant configurations but also the direct application of heat in industry and household uses regardless of meteorological conditions. In this study, a research review is carried out on the aspect of geothermal energy development, assessing power plant technology and direct heat applications. Five power plant configurations are studied: single-flash, double-flash, dry-steam, binary and advanced. The thermodynamic aspects are addressed in order to consider them for future geothermal power plant analysis. Furthermore, the most common direct uses of geothermal heat are discussed. Results illustrate that Binary – Organic Ranking Cycle Power Plants might play a vital role in the exploitation of low temperature geothermal resources. Furthermore, it is identified a need for research in hybrid geothermal-solar-biomass configurations for poly-generation purposes. These configurations increase the energy output, increasing the thermal efficiency and increasing the life of the geothermal reservoir. Similarly, direct applications of geothermal heat present good opportunities for increasing the revenue of a geothermal project. Depending of the geographic zone, cascade configurations contributes to maximise the use of geothermal resources.

Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n = 383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n = 6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use.

Numerous large-scale decomposition experiments have been conducted focusing on this fundamental soil process in order to understand the controls on the terrestrial carbon transfer to the atmosphere. However, previous studies were mostly based on site-specific litter and methodologies, adding major uncertainty to syntheses, comparisons and meta-analyses across different experiments and sites. In the TeaComposition initiative, the potential litter decomposition is investigated by using standardized substrates (Rooibos and Green tea) for comparison of litter mass loss at 336 sites (ranging from −9 to +26 °C MAT and from 60 to 3113 mm MAP) across different ecosystems. In this study we tested the effect of climate (temperature and moisture), litter type and land-use on early stage decomposition (3 months) across nine biomes. We show that litter quality was the predominant controlling factor in early stage litter decomposition, which explained about 65% of the variability in litter decomposition at a global scale. The effect of climate, on the other hand, was not litter specific and explained <0.5% of the variation for Green tea and 5% for Rooibos tea, and was of significance only under unfavorable decomposition conditions (i.e. xeric versus mesic environments). When the data were aggregated at the biome scale, climate played a significant role on decomposition of both litter types (explaining 64% of the variation for Green tea and 72% for Rooibos tea). No significant effect of land-use on early stage litter decomposition was noted within the temperate biome. Our results indicate that multiple drivers are affecting early stage litter mass loss with litter quality being dominant. In order to be able to quantify the relative importance of the different drivers over time, long-term studies combined with experimental trials are needed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.', 'Carbon turnover', '628-629', NULL, 1369, 1394, 82, '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.012', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042424360&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.01.012&partnerID=40&md5=598ece9ffdd870b96aa382dbc4b6ee0e', '2-s2.0-85042424360', 20),

Design/methodology/approach: Pre- and post-assessments, activity journals and on-line interviews are used to measure the impact of internships on high school students’ sustainability leadership, using a train-the-trainer intervention led by university interns. A conceptual problem-solving framework is proposed and empirically tested to explore the linkages between complex problem constellations, sustainability transition strategies and sustainability visions. Findings: The five core leadership competencies (systems thinking, strategic, anticipatory, normative and interpersonal) may not be as uniquely discrete as suggested in the literature. An effective learning experience depends on students’ developing competence in their ability to implement a strategic intervention, which is better acquired through hands-on experience rather than a classroom setting. Practical implications: Students need experiential learning outside of the classroom to make sustainability come alive as a viable option for their communities. Social implications: The principles of social responsivity, engagement, experiential learning, capacity-building and entrepreneurialism can be executed by transforming the campus into a learning lab, which includes the local community. Originality/value: This study empirically demonstrates that students need involvement in strategic interventions to imagine and conceptualize sustainability visions. It also shows how academia can help fulfill the United Nations sustainable development goals. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.', 'Community', '19', NULL, 739, 755, 5, '10.1108/IJSHE-06-2017-0097', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043453718&doi=10.1108%2fIJSHE-06-2017-0097&partnerID=40&md5=245dc4ac790b2c28def2731d52c3bea3', '2-s2.0-85043453718', 26),

Accordingly, there has been some shift in development thinking and investment from previous efforts, which has focused only on improving the efficiency of household fuel use, to those that focus on reducing exposure to the air pollution that leads to health impact. Unfortunately, however, this is occurring just as the climate agenda has come to dominate much of the discourse and action on international sustainable development. Thus, instead of optimizing approaches that centrally focus on the large health impact, the household energy agenda has been hampered by the constraints imposed by a narrow definition of sustainability - one primarily driven by the desire to mitigate greenhouse emissions by relying on renewable biomass fueling so-called improved cookstoves. In reality, however, solid biomass is extremely difficult to burn sufficiently cleanly in household stoves to reach health goals. In comparison to the international development community, however, some large countries, notably Brazil historically and more recently, India have substantially expanded the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in their household energy mix, using their own resources, having a major impact on their national energy picture. The net climate impact of such approaches compared to current biomass stoves is minimal or non-existent, and the social and health benefits are, in contrast, potentially great. LPG can be seen as a transition fuel for clean household energy, with induction stoves powered by renewables as the holy grail (an approach already being adopted by Ecuador as also discussed here).

It is important to pursue alternatives, such as outsourcing, in the process of deciding how to manage CSR and assessing the impact on supply chain management (SCM). We studied the implications of incorporating non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in SCM to achieve CSR goals.

In order to achieve this, the energy mix is essential and must be modified. The different projections that accomplish this goal agree that most of the sectors must depend on electricity and the electric sector must be based on renewable sources. However, renewable energy technologies are more mineral intensive than current energy sources. In this study the material requirements for the green technologies needed to meet the 2ºC target has been identified and assessed through the concept of exergy replacement costs, which is a novel measure that evaluates mineral resources as a function of their scarcity in the crust and the energy intensity to mine and refine them. Through this concept, one can evaluate and represent in Sankey diagrams, the exergy demand associated to the use of fuel and non-fuel minerals in the different technologies proposed for the new energy transition. As a result, we have obtained that the transition towards a low carbon economy will reduce the exergy consumption of non-renewable resources.

Argentina is an interesting case to explore given its high smoking rates, its recent experience with periods of very high and hyperinflation, and the mixed evidence of the effect of prices on smoking onset, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We used data from four cycles of two large national surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011 and discrete-time hazard models. We found that tobacco prices had a statistically significant and fairly large impact on the hazard of smoking onset, and these findings were robust to alternative specifications. We also found that prices had little effect on the hazards of smoking onset during periods of hyper- and very high inflation, which provide some support for the notion that prices lose their informational role in such periods. Governments need to be cognizant that their most important policy tool to reduce tobacco use—taxes that increase real tobacco prices—is likely no longer effective during these times.

Indigenous agricultural practices in the western Amazon Basin are known as chakras, and their structure and dynamics are seemingly optimal for forest management. However, the variability in tree species and the degree of forest recovery after abandonment is poorly documented in this agroforestry system (AFS). The goals of this study were: (i) to investigate whether the different AFSs (chakras) preserve similar levels of forest diversity, (ii) to determine the effect of transformation of mature forests (MF) to chakras, in particular, forest alpha and beta diversity levels, and (iii) to investigate whether native tree species recovery leads to the original forest structure following chakra abandonment. Methods We assessed the floristic composition in three AFSs (cassava, corn, and cocoa), the secondary forest (SF), and the forest remnants in the buffer zone of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). All tree species with a diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥10 cm were inventoried in 61 plots (0.28 ha average) representing 17.44 ha. Alpha diversity was calculated in all systems to determine the levels of variability using species richness and the Shannon diversity index. Also, beta diversity was examined to evaluate the degree of dissimilarity among all AFSs with the MF in order to analyze changes in floristic composition. The divergence between the SF and the MF was analyzed to ascertain forest recovery after chakra abandonment. Important Findings A total of 4,060 trees (dbh ≥ 10 cm) representing 109 species, 96 genera, and 43 plant families were inventoried in 17.44 ha sampled in five systems in the buffer zone of the NEA.

Understanding today\'s gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. Methods: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 25th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 975th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target.

The paper sheds light on claim making patterns in transnational contention, in particular how these affect the making and unmaking of (state-led) insider-outsider coalitions. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.', 'environmental justice', '3', NULL, 226, 236, 3, '10.1080/23251042.2017.1295836', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050738490&doi=10.1080%2f23251042.2017.1295836&partnerID=40&md5=0ad6db517b1b70e8dd7ec30e3219257a', '2-s2.0-85050738490', 61),

Agricultural activity has undergone several changes throughout history, starting as a primitive process at an early stage, going through traditional agriculture and reaching what is called modern agriculture. As for the last one, and specifically when it makes use of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), some characteristics have been identified by means of a literature review in the projects deployed worldwide that allow us to propose a way to classify them into four categories: Projects for education and dissemination of information, for environmental care, for online trading, and for the increasement of production and adding value. It should be noted that almost any project involving agriculture and ICT has a comprehensive approach, but they usually focus on one of the categories previously mentioned. Since one of the goals of this paper is to show the advantages that Infocentros can bring to the agricultural activity in Ecuador in order to become a tool for the deployment of e-agriculture (a concept that involves ICT with the agricultural activity), it is interesting to note that after analyzing official statistics, we have found that the usage and access of Ecuadorian rural population to ICT has increased in recent years, as well as the infrastructure supporting such technology. It has been also identified that Infocentros are the most common place for Internet access in those areas. These facts support the idea that nowadays Infocentros could become a key factor in the deployment of e-agriculture in Ecuador. © 2017 IEEE.', NULL, NULL, 7962532, 189, 194, 1, '10.1109/ICEDEG.2017.7962532', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026835254&doi=10.1109%2fICEDEG.2017.7962532&partnerID=40&md5=23c2af0fd8e9a45cc343223a80f8aa6c', '2-s2.0-85026835254', 62),

This study aims to assess the water-related impacts of agriculture combining the use of an ecohydrological model (SWAT) with a spatiotemporal water footprint assessment to evaluate the current status of streamflow (blue water), soil water (green water) and the assimilability of sediments by streamflow (grey water footprint). The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) requires farmers to adopt certain agricultural practices that are beneficial for the environment.

The study lasted 25 weeks and was undertaken in the ictiohidrographic area of Province of Los Rios, which accounts for 35 % of native fish species in Ecuador. Weekly, the individual biometric parameters total length (L), body width (BW) and body depth (BD) of 90 juve­niles of C. festae were measured.

This study set out to describe the association between the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) estimates and a set of socioeconomic indicators and compute the MMR inequalities among the provinces of Ecuador. Methods. A cross-sectional ecological study was conducted, using data for 2014 from the country\'s 24 provinces. The MMR estimate was calculated for each province, as well as the association and its strength between MMR and specific socioeconomic indicators. For the indicators that were found to be significantly associated with MMR, inequality measurements were computed. Results. Despite a relatively low MMR for Ecuador overall, ratios differed substantially among the provinces. Five socioeconomic indicators proved to be statistically significantly associated with MMR: Total fertility rate, the percentage of indigenous population, the percentage of households with children who do not attend school, gross domestic product, and the percentage of houses with electrical service. Of these five, only three had MMR inequalities that were significant: Total fertility rate, gross domestic product, and the percentage of households with electricity. Conclusions. This study supports research arguing that national averages can be misleading, as they often hide differences among subgroups at the local level. The findings also suggest that MMR is significantly associated with some socioeconomic indicators, including ones linked with significant health outcome inequalities. In order to reduce health inequities, it is crucial that countries look beyond national averages and identify the subgroups being left behind, explore the particular social determinants that generate these health inequalities, and examine the specific barriers and other factors affecting the subgroups most vulnerable to maternal health inequalities.', 'Ecuador', '41', 0, NULL, NULL, 11, NULL, 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025639459&partnerID=40&md5=5a08da50652d61eb898f6a08cb62250b', '2-s2.0-85025639459', 73),

The method reallocates investments in order to minimize levels of surface roughness and total travel time. Travel time considers expected speed from the combination of a set of elements such as type of terrain and pavement surface and its condition. A case study of about 960 km of strategic roads in the province of El Oro in Ecuador was used to demonstrate the application of the method. It was found that a massive campaign of paving should be undertaken in order to both improve average road conditions and the accessibility to basic services. The system dedicated about half of the budget to convert gravel roads into paved ones and the other half for maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing network.

The research engages in a dialogue between the perspectives of critical nutrition and political ecology, as it seeks to clarify and develop a critical perspective on health promotion and health education. Critical nutrition studies and political ecology highlight the need to consider and also act upon the broader connections of, and influences on, food and nutrition. In a CHE approach, students learn to address the wider determinants of health through critical, democratic and collaborative processes, anchored in and supported by the local community. Based on a textual analysis of health, food and education policy documents, the study finds that concrete norms endorse a biomedical stance. Consequently, focus remains on prescribing individual behavior, and schools are regarded as intervention settings, rather than a site for generating change as would be the case of health promotion using a CHE viewpoint. However, the study finds the possibility for developing a CHE perspective in the overarching rationale of \'good living\', which reaffirms a holistic understanding of health, the need for critical and plural participation and the importance of the community. It is possible that the notion of community participation could facilitate introducing a CHE approach in Ecuadorian schools. © The Author 2016.', 'Community', '32', NULL, 331, 339, 6, '10.1093/heapro/daw037', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019759417&doi=10.1093%2fheapro%2fdaw037&partnerID=40&md5=e47c73d74d561134be241488b7082aad', '2-s2.0-85019759417', 80),

The engine vibrations are primarily understood as effects of mechanical failures, but they are also a subject of the fuel combustion effects. These effects depend on the fuel type and its ability to complete the combustion process. The vibrations of a diesel engine were measured and analyzed with a frequency spectrum calculated with fast Fourier transforms. The engine was operated with a fuel blend of 10 % recycled lubricating oil with 90% diesel fuel as well as with neat diesel. It was found that the engine operation with this fuel blend has a lower vibration level in comparison with the use of neat diesel fuel. The goal of this research is to determine the properties of the fuel blend, which provide more stability to the engine by means of vibrations reduction. The fuel properties that influence the engine stability are the flash point, the cetane number and the heat value. Improvements of these properties allow keeping of the engine performance with better stability during its operation at different speeds. Testing of the engine performance by means of vibrations analysis is a powerful tool to determine engine behavior from the functional and endurance point of view.

Despite national and subnational conservation strategies developed in Ecuador to conserve its biodiversity in the long run, including the National System of Protected Areas (PANE) and the forest conservation incentive program SocioBosque (PSB), further actions are needed to mitigate and reverse the effects of threats for the persistence of biodiversity. This study was designed to identify the most important areas for biodiversity conservation in mainland Ecuador that can contribute to preserving key species (i.e. endemic, threatened) and ecosystems in the wider landscape, thus complementing current conservation efforts (i.e. PANE). Species distribution models and recent maps were used to identify a set of 744 species and 87 ecosystems as surrogates of the country’s biodiversity. Marxan, a systematic reserve selection algorithm was used to identify important biodiversity areas that could represent between 10% and 20% of the remnant distribution of the surrogates. The optimized solution generated by Marxan included 24% (3.64 million ha) of Ecuador′s remnant vegetation, of which 35% is within the current national protected area system and 13% (456 000 ha) are included within SocioBosque communal and private conservation agreements. Major conservation shortfalls of the PANE were concentrated in the Southern Andes, Central Amazonia, and the Central and Southern portions of the Coastal plain. The incidence of complementary criteria to prioritize conservation strategies, related to climate change, ecosystem conversion, carbon and accessibility, and population density change in relation to the important biodiversity areas was heterogeneous among regions.

Even after these decades of investigation, do we know how to define and measure success? We systematically reviewed 26 studies of stream restoration projects that used macroinvertebrate indicators to assess the success of habitat heterogeneity restoration projects. All 26 studies were previously included in two meta-analyses that sought to assess whether restoration programs were succeeding. By contrast, our review focuses on the evaluations themselves, and asks what exactly we are measuring and learning from these evaluations. All 26 studies used taxonomic diversity, richness, or abundance of invertebrates as biological measures of success, but none presented explicit arguments why those metrics were relevant measures of success for the restoration projects. Although changes in biodiversity may reflect overall ecological condition at the regional or global scale, in the context of reach-scale habitat restoration, more abundance and diversity may not necessarily be better. While all 26 studies sought to evaluate the biotic response to habitat heterogeneity enhancement projects, about half of the studies (46%) explicitly measured habitat alteration, and 31% used visual estimates of grain size or subjectively judged \'habitat quality\' from protocols ill-suited for the purpose. Although the goal of all 26 projects was to increase habitat heterogeneity, 31% of the studies either sampled only riffles or did not specify the habitats sampled.

Although there are relatively few major data sources for LCA, the data themselves are presented with highly heterogeneous formats, interfaces, and distribution mechanisms. The lack of agreement among data providers for descriptions of processes and flows creates substantial barriers for information sharing and reuse of practitioners’ models. Nevertheless, the many data resources share a common logic. The use of Semantic Web technologies and text mining techniques can facilitate the interpretation of data from diverse sources. Numerous existing efforts have been made to articulate a knowledge model for LCA. In March of 2015 a joint workshop was held that brought together leading international domain experts with ontology engineers to develop a set of simple models called ontology design patterns (ODPs) for LCA information. In this paper we build on the outcomes of the workshop, as well as prior published works, to derive a minimal “consensus model” for LCA. We use the consensus model to derive a description of an LCA “catalog” that can be used to express the semantic content of a data resource. We generate catalogs of several prominent databases, and make those catalogs available to the public for independent use. Finally, we “link” those catalogs to existing knowledge models using JSON-LD, a linked data format that can expose the catalog contents to Semantic Web tools.

The effectiveness of ecologically focused restoration approaches typically is limited in urban settings because of the use of a reference-condition approach, mismatches between the temporal and spatial scales of impacts and restoration activities, and lack of an integrative approach that incorporates ecological and societal objectives. Developers of new frameworks are recognizing the opportunities for and benefits from incorporating societal outcomes into urban stream restoration projects. Social, economic, cultural, or other benefits to local communities are often opportunistic or arise indirectly from actions intended to achieve ecological outcomes. We propose urban stream renovation as a flexible stream improvement framework in which short-term ecological and societal outcomes are leveraged to achieve long-term ecological objectives. The framework is designed to provide additional opportunities for beneficial outcomes that are often unattainable from ecologically focused restoration approaches. Urban stream renovation uses an iterative process whereby short-term ecological and societal outcomes generate public support for future actions, which may provide opportunities to address catchment-level causes of impairment that often exist across broad temporal scales. Adaptive management, education, and outreach are needed to maintain long-term public engagement. Thus, future work should focus on understanDing how ecological and societal contexts interact, how to assess societal outcomes to maintain stewardship, developing new methods for effective education and outreach, and multidisciplinary collaborations.

Today, with the further problems created by the massive influx of tourists, is it necessary to establish planned areas of urban expansion that are already equipped with a suitable system of collection and treatment of wastewater. This paper focuses on the city of Puerto Ayora, the main town of the island of Santa Cruz, where increasing human pressure has led to, among various other consequences, an increase in water demand, which has highlighted the inadequacy of the current wastewater treatment system, based primarily on single-family septic tanks without additional depuration. Among the various actions proposed to solve the increasing health and environmental hazards, caused by the partially treated wastewater, a centralized sewer system for the drainage and the depuration of the wastewater produced by the users connected to the network has been proposed in order to serve the community of Puerto Ayora. This project is currently experiencing a slow implementation process due to technical difficulties. Our intention is to propose a different wastewater management system, which is modular, easily replicable and which requires low maintenance.

To meet the need for evidence to guide ongoing decisions, we assessed the goals and strategies of 16 programs that were operating in 2013-2014 in association with the Latin American Water Funds Partnership. Our findings underscore the diversity within this approach to investment in watershed services. The various financial, governance, and management mechanisms adopted by these programs reflected their distinct biophysical, socio-economic, and political contexts. All 16 water funds aimed to secure water quality (15/16) and/or quantity (including the timing of flows) (14/16). The majority of programs also explicitly strived for co-benefits to local livelihoods (9/16) and biodiversity (11/16). Public funding secured through legislation provided the most funding to date, but private, NGO, and development bank source were also important for some programs. While programs have actively engaged rural land stewards, this stakeholder group was represented on governance boards in just 4 of 16 funds. Additionally, while the majority of water funds with activities on the ground (13/16) reported biophysical and social impact monitoring (8/16), many faced significant logistical, technical, and funding challenges to its implementation.

In this vein, a formal model including performance evaluation as a partial mediator between human capital components and pay in a Latin American setting is developed and tested.

The main existing land use in the research area is milk production on pasture, with some farmers having forest land. Our results suggest that most farmers would significantly increase the area under conservation and/or restoration as part of their risk reduction strategies, compared to a decision based solely on expected returns. However, in land use allocations that maximise the return per unit of risk, a small group of milk producers without forest would continue milk production on most of their land. In addition, milk producers with forest would significantly decrease deforestation under the land use allocations made when conservation incentives are available. Against this we also identify a likely shift of milk production from existing pasture to new pasture established on deforested land, which provides evidence of a potential \'leakage effect\'. In addition, the incentive programmes would only lead to small areas of tree plantations being established. None of the land use combinations (portfolios) analysed would increase the income of all households to above the poverty line, as the monetary incentives are too low and many farms are too small. For forest holders all the land use combinations we studied would have a positive impact on income, but we observed a negative impact on household income for milk producers without forest. For producers without any forest, there seems to be a trade-off between maximising household income and risk reduction through combining incentives for restoration and tree plantations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.', 'Diversification', '51', NULL, 244, 259, 14, '10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.11.019', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948783847&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2015.11.019&partnerID=40&md5=723020af9cdd4c038684db5099f060bc', '2-s2.0-84948783847', 104),

From the point of view of the sustainable development, this is interesting because, on the one hand, the resources are to be useful to the maximum, and for other one, the waste disposal decreases. A good example is the use of a great variety of agricultural crop residues and agroindustrial by-products as substrates in the production of edible mushrooms. Mushroom cultivation is an efficient biotechnological process, since high performances and good productivity are achieved with low environmental controls. Mushrooms grow in a wide range of temperature, in short periods and has the ability of biodegrade different lignocellulosic substrates. This makes possible the valorization of agricultural, forest and agroindustrial residues regionally available. In Mexico, mushroom cultivation is an important economic and ecological activity, because it generates employments and enables the use and recycling of more than 500,000 tons of agricultural, agroindustrial and forest residues, per year. Moreover, it reduces the environmental impact of the final disposition of green residues.

This article develops a critique of this paradigm, focusing on the case of the Millennium Villages Project (MVP), and its implementation in Bonsaaso, Ghana. The author interprets the MVP as a staging of the neoliberal fantasy of origins - an imagined history of the spontaneous emergence of capitalism in the frugal activities of smallholder farmers. In Bonsaaso, this fantasy has been shattered by the violence of primitive accumulation - the separation of the peasantry from the land through which capitalist social relations are actually established. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Bonsaaso, the author describes how an influx of foreign gold miners has plunged the region into a profound socio-ecological crisis. Despite producing several internal reports on this crisis, the MVP has failed to respond to it, and has instead sought to restage its fantasy in a new Village in the north of the country. Yet an analysis of its background documents and financial networks demonstrates the complicity of the MVP in the political economy of primitive accumulation underway in Bonsaaso.

The problem outlined is neither a technical nor political one: being essentially related to knowledge production it calls for the pluralization of approaches to both global ethics and sustainability. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.', 'agriculture', '11', NULL, 294, 302, 4, '10.1080/17449626.2015.1084523', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949675093&doi=10.1080%2f17449626.2015.1084523&partnerID=40&md5=cfa45a82d4c9df9df70b340ea0056dcc', '2-s2.0-84949675093', 114),

We do so in three ways. First, we propose the need for a new, \"see through\" taxonomy for knowledge-based innovation as we transition from the material industries (e.g., textiles, plastic, cement, glass) dominant in the 20th century to the anticipated knowledge industry of the 21st century. If knowledge is the currency of the present century, then it is sensible to adopt an approach that thoroughly examines scientific knowledge, starting with the production aims, methods, quality, distribution, access, and the ends it purports to serve. Second, we explain that this knowledge trajectory focus on innovation is crucial and applicable across all sectors, including public, private, or public-private partnerships, as it underscores the fact that scientific knowledge is a co-product of technology, human values, and social systems. By making the value systems embedded in scientific design and knowledge co-production transparent, we all stand to benefit from sustainable and transparent science. Third, we appeal to the global health community to consider the necessary qualities of good governance for 21st century organizations that will embark on developing essential diagnostics.

This study analyzed 342 residential buildings built from 1981 to 2015 and characterized their parameters (areas, orientation, number of stories, etc.), envelopes, domestic hot water, and heating and air-conditioning systems. Based on this characterization, a model single-family dwelling and another model multifamily dwelling were designed to evaluate their energy efficiency as a function of changes in construction and their cost in southeast Spain. The main results were that recently built buildings (built after 2006) have included domestic hot water from solar sources, insulating materials in their envelopes and have considerably improved construction systems, due to the requirements of current legislation. Fruit of these improvements is a drop in CO2 emissions of up to 82%, according to calculations done with official programmes.

In particular, traditional agroforestry could be critical to both biological conservation and human livelihoods in human-altered rainforest areas. However, traditional agroforestry is rapidly disappearing, because the system itself is economically precarious, and because the forest trees that shade traditional crops are now perceived to be overly detrimental to agricultural yield. Here, we show a case where the commonly used agroforestry shade metric, canopy cover, would indeed suggest complete removal of shade trees to maximize yield, with strongly negative biodiversity and climate implications. However, a yield over 50% higher was achievable if approximately 100 shade trees per hectare were planted in a spatially organized fashion, a win-win for biodiversity and the smallholder. The higher yield option was detected by optimizing simultaneously for canopy cover, and a second shade metric, neighboring tree density, which was designed to better capture the yield value of ecological services flowing from forest trees. Nevertheless, even a 50% yield increase may prove insufficient to stop farmers converting away from traditional agroforestry. To further increase agroforestry rents, we apply our results to the design of a sustainable certification (eco-labelling) scheme for cocoa-based products in a biodiversity hotspot, and consider their implications for the use of the United Nations REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) program in agroforestry systems. Combining yield boost, certification, and REDD has the potential to incentivize eco-friendly agroforestry and lift smallholders out of poverty, simultaneously. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.', 'Agroforestry', '25', NULL, 361, 372, 11, '10.1890/13-0313.1.sm', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964285731&doi=10.1890%2f13-0313.1.sm&partnerID=40&md5=96bd69adf66a46b4504191a60140ed6b', '2-s2.0-84964285731', 119),

This paper uses semi-structured interviews and participatory mapping to examine how ethnically diverse communities interact with a proposed Ramsar designation wetland system in Ecuador. This research sought to explore locals’ associations with the wetlands and their views of prominent conservation disturbances occurring in the area. Communities are affected by limited mobility due to the geographic nature of the region, which has affected their interaction with and understanding of the wetlands and shaped economic development in the region. Currently, road development, more than any other disturbance, will determine the future of the wetland, opening to the region for economic development or creating and understanding for the need to care for the crucial water source in the region.

However, few mechanisms have been proposed or developed to understand, identify or assess the impacts of volunteer tourism in host communities. One strategy to assess these impacts is by developing sociocultural, economic and environmental indicators. Literature on international development, social indicators and volunteer tourism suggests that indicator development should engage both host communities and volunteer tourism organizations (VTOs). This article presents an approach to accomplish this often difficult task. An online questionnaire solicited data from VTOs regarding indicators that they believe are most useful to understand the community impacts of their programs. Exploratory workshops in five host communities of volunteer tourism in Ecuador and Costa Rica generated additional indicators that are locally-relevant and appropriate. Data from these distinct approaches to indicator development are compared and contrasted to understand how they can be used to reflect the interests of both stakeholder groups. The compass of sustainability was used as a framework to guide indicator development for both the survey and the workshops and its potential to guide future initiatives is discussed.

The comparison of the changes in the energetic metabolic pattern has the scope to characterize and explain a bifurcation in their evolutionary path in the recent years, using the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach. The analysis shows an impressive transformation of China\'s energy metabolism determined by the joining of the WTO in 2001. Since then, China became the largest factory of the world with a generalized capitalization of all sectors, especially the industrial sector, boosting economic labor productivity as well as total energy consumption. India, on the contrary, lags behind when considering these factors. Looking at changes in the household sector (energy metabolism associated with final consumption) in the case of China, the energetic metabolic rate (EMR) soared in the last decade, also thanks to a reduced growth of population, whereas in India it remained stagnant for the last 40 years. This analysis indicates a big challenge for India for the next decade. In the light of the data analyzed both countries will continue to require strong injections of technical capital requiring a continuous increase in their total energy consumption. When considering the size of these economies it is easy to guess that this may induce a dramatic increase in the price of energy, an event that at the moment will penalize much more the chance of a quick economic development of India. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on the experiences of two different PES programs in Latin America, we examine how PES institutions fit with the tenets of adaptive decision-making for sustainable resource management. We identify how the program goals and the connection to the market influence the incentive structure, information gathering, learning and feedback processes, and the structure of decision-making rights, specifically the ability to make and modify resource-use rules. Although limited in their generalizability, findings from the two case studies suggest a tension between the contractual model of PES and adaptive decision-making in natural resource systems. PES programs are not inherently decentralized, flexible management tools, as PES contracts tend to restrict decision-making rights and offer minimal flexibility mechanisms to change resource-use practices over the duration of the contract period. Furthermore, PES design and flexibility is heavily dependent on the goals and mission of the buyer and the respective market. If PES is to facilitate sustainable resource management, greater attention is needed to assess how the institutional design of the PES contracts influence the motivation and capacity of participants and program officers alike to adaptively manage the respective resource systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.', 'Adaptive management', '55', NULL, 69, 85, 13, '10.1007/s00267-014-0380-1', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920766436&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-014-0380-1&partnerID=40&md5=03c08cacee77374418e7c90848c0633f', '2-s2.0-84920766436', 126),

Based on semi-structured interviews with early program participants enrolling either collectively- or individually-held land, we evaluated whether and how SocioPáramo, a national-scale PES program targeting Ecuadorian Andean grasslands (páramos), has the potential to contribute to local livelihoods (financial, natural, social, human, and physical capital) and sustainable resource management. Low conservation opportunity costs associated with pre-existing constraints on land use and the existence of alternative livelihood options appeared to facilitate largely positive financial capital outcomes, although we found reduced financial capital among some smaller and medium-sized landholders who were required to eliminate burning and grazing. We found the greatest potential for improved social, financial, and natural capital among well-organized community participants enrolling collective land, while greater attention to building capacity of individual smaller landholders could improve outcomes for those participants. These results help fill a gap in knowledge by drawing on empirical data to demonstrate how divergent outcomes have begun to emerge among different groups of SocioPáramo participants, providing lessons for PES program design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.', 'Conservation', '8', NULL, 148, 165, 44, '10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.03.007', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902259971&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoser.2014.03.007&partnerID=40&md5=b045de50ceffac8cde076a00a0b35171', '2-s2.0-84902259971', 131),

Hydrogen could be produced using hydropower either alone or combined with other renewable energy sources. For this study, we analyzed two scenarios of energy availability based on data from the largest hydroelectric power plant in the country. The first scenario assumes that an amount of water equivalent to 30% of that spilled in 2011 could be used to generate additional electricity. Thus, an additional amount of energy equivalent to 5% of the energy produced in 2011 could be available. The second scenario doubles this amount of energy. Economic analysis showed that to obtain low-cost hydrogen (3.00US$/kg) it is necessary to operate the electrolysis plants 24h/day, using low-cost electricity (30US$/MWh). A continuous supply of energy could be possible when new hydroelectric utilities start operating or by integrating hydropower with solar and wind. Three possibilities for using hydrogen are discussed: 1) production of ammonia as a raw material for nitrogenous fertilizers, 2) hydro-treating heavy oils and bio-oils in oil refineries, and 3) as an energy storage medium to offset natural instability and unpredictability of renewables. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.', 'Ecuador', '64', NULL, 626, 631, 23, '10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.012', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891489965&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2013.11.012&partnerID=40&md5=85435cc4db95c5c3b5e5b06da0f3bc98', '2-s2.0-84891489965', 132),

A common goal in managing a botanical living collection is to maintain the greatest biodiversity at the greatest economic and logistic efficiency. However to date there is no unified strategy for managing living plants within and among botanic gardens. We propose a strategy that combines three indicators of the management priority of a collection: information on species imperilment, genetic representation, and the operational costs associated to maintaining genetic representation. In combination or alone, these indicators can be used to assay effectiveness and efficiency of living collections, and to assign a numeric conservation value to an accession. We illustrate this approach using endangered palms that have been studied to varying degrees. Management decisions can be readily extended to other species based on our indicators. Thus, the conservation value of a species can be shared through existing databases with other botanic gardens and provide a list of recommendations toward a combined management strategy for living collections.

Conservationists and wildlife managers around the world use translocation to new and/or newly safe habitats as a tool for preserving and propagating threatened species whose populations are surviving at only few and vulnerable localities. The success of translocations is typically defined as the establishment of a self-sustaining population. However, this definition overlooks the genetic consequences of translocations at the metapopulation scale, especially when maintaining genetic diversity is one of the specific aims of immediate and/or long-term management goals for the translocated population. We evaluated the potential effects of translocation on the total genetic diversity of a metapopulation in an increasingly common scenario: a small island as the source site, and a nearby predator-proofed, large island as the target site. Specifically, we tested the counterintuitive hypothesis that translocation and subsequent migration between an expanding, recently established population and the original population might actually result in the suppression of genetic diversity in the metapopulation relative to the temporal course of genetic drift in the small island population without translocation (control). Our simulations confirm that the directional genetic consequences of translocations are complex and depend on the combination of parameter estimates used for the modelling. Critically, however, under a lower rate of migration, lower rate of growth and higher carrying capacity on the translocation site, and smaller initial size of the translocated population, the total genetic diversity of the metapopulation may become suppressed following a translocation, relative to the control. At the same time, when translocations are carried out under a broader set of conditions, the metapopulation genetic diversity will typically exceed that of the control.

Integrating the inputs of decision-makers and local people into scientifically rigorous conservation planning is a critically important aspect of effective conservation implementation. Protected areas represent an essential component of approaches designed to conserve biodiversity. However, given that wildlife, ecological processes and human activities often spill across the boundaries of protected areas, designing strategies aimed at managing protected areas as components of larger human-dominated landscapes will be necessary for successful conservation. Identifying strategies that simultaneously benefit biodiversity conservation and economic development is a challenge that remains at the forefront of applied conservation. Biodiversity use may not be able to alleviate poverty, but may have an important role in sustaining the livelihoods of the poor, and preventing further impoverishment. Strong institutions and good governance are prerequisites for successful conservation interventions. Capacity needs for practical conservation in developing countries occur at many levels from the skills needed for management of natural resources to the compliance requirements of multilateral agreements. Filling gaps in capacity involves a diversity of approaches from on-the-job training of individuals to restructuring academic and professional training programs. Prioritizing capacity needs is vital to a longer-term vision of enabling responsible stewardship of biodiversity. The engagement of local communities in planning and implementation is critical for effective conservation.

A survey of health care workers\' knowledge and practices of occupational health (OH) and infection control (IC) revealed positive practices such as a medical waste disposal program and widespread dissemination of health information.

Various studies are showing however that most programs have a rather traditional focus and fail to pay attention to the six principles that UNESCO identified as laying at the basis of environmental education. The article shows how to meet several of the UNESCO principles in a comprehensive program. First it points at the paradigmatic nature of environmental education. Every program starts from certain paradigmatic assumptions. It is important to clarify and explicify these assumptions. To illustrate how to do this the article presents the work of Lucie Sauvé and the various paradigms on sustainability she distinguishes. The article goes on to emphasize the important position that the participants (teachers and students) have in their capacities as human beings with emotions, dreams, creative ideas, a past and visions for the future. Environmental issues often are presented as existing outside of the participants. The article claims that the participants are an integral part of the issues and they should involve themselves as \'subjects under change\' in programs of environmental education. The experiential learning cycle of David Kolb is presented as a model that helps to identify various learning and change processes inside the participants as well as around the participants of environmental education.

Unlike other oceanic archipelagos, the ecological and evolutionary processes characteristic of Galapagos have been minimally affected by human activities, and the archipelago still retains most of its original, unique biodiversity. However, several recent reports suggest that the development model has turned unsustainable and that the unique values of the archipelago might be seriously at risk. In response to international concern, UNESCO added Galapagos to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2007. Our goal was to provide new insights into the origins of the present-day crisis and suggest possible management alternatives. To this end, we re-examined the Galapagos situation from a broad systems perspective, conceptualizing the archipelago as a complex social-ecological system. Past, present, and possible future trends were explored using the resilience theory as a perspective for understanding the dynamics of the system. Four major historical periods were characterized and analyzed using Holling\'s adaptive cycle metaphor. The current Galapagos situation was characterized as a prolonged series of crisis events followed by renewal attempts that have not yet been completed. Three plausible future scenarios were identified, with tourism acting as the primary driver of change. The current tourism model reduces the system\'s resilience through its effects on the economy, population growth, resource consumption, invasive species arrival, and lifestyle of the island residents. Opportunities to reorganize and maintain a desirable state do exist.

The conceptual framework calls for attention first to balancing crop nutrition that in nearly every case will also increase crop productivity, allowing sufficient staple to be produced on less land so that the remaining land can be devoted to more nutrient-dense and nutrient-balancing crops.

Due to mismanagement of information and bad definition of goals by the government, a massive interest in acquiring communal lands started in the Peninsula of Santa Elena (PSE) after the government announced the construction plan of a large public irrigation system. During this process, information asymmetries regarding the potential of the irrigation system always prevailed in favor of land buyers. After eight years of functioning of the irrigation system, less than 20 percent of its capacity is in use. This leads to a situation in which the operation and maintenance of the canals is not appropriate, thus endangering sustainability of agriculture itself. This paper starts from the hypothesis that AI has an important impact over the observed pattern of land use and therefore irrigation in the PSE. Under the condition of AI for public goods with costly access, a test was conducted to determine which of the characteristics for an optimal allocation fits in the case of the PSE. Farmer\'s marginal cost of access to irrigation in connection with the concentration of the property of land by new landholders is considered the relevant informational variable. The most important result of this paper is that the presence of AI induces a scenario in which new landholders demand a smaller quantity of irrigation because of the high marginal costs of farming on big farm plots. A second important result suggests that subsidies to new landowners through the provision of irrigation appear to increase inequality with respect to peasant-commoners. © Springer 2006.', 'Asymmetric information', '20', NULL, 431, 447, 6, '10.1007/s11269-006-1292-5', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954850845&doi=10.1007%2fs11269-006-1292-5&partnerID=40&md5=e70ccdcd8847207dffd48ae2b6f8633f', '2-s2.0-77954850845', 155),

We analyzed 3084 references published between 1834 and 2001 in terms of years of publication, geographic regions, topics, and taxonomic groups. We found that the decades of 1980s and 1990s experienced a notable increase in the number of publications: 64% of the 3084 references appeared since 1980.

Among families, Emberizidae (280) were the one with most references, followed by Trochilidae and Psittacidae.

Water is captured in a high-altitude region of the watershed and distributed downstream to producers in four elevation-defined zones via a system of canals. Upstream and downstream producers face radically different conditions with respect to climate and terrain. A mathematical programming model was created to study the consequences of addressing chronic water scarcity problems in the watershed by shifting water resources between the four zones. The model captures the nature of water use by humans, crops and dual purpose cattle. Its Objective function maximizes producer welfare as measured by aggregate gross margin, subject to limited supplies of land, labor and water. Five water allocation scenarios are evaluated with respect to efficiency in land and water use and equity in income distribution. Results reveal that although water is the primary constrained resource downstream, in the upstream zones, land is far more scarce. The current distribution of water rights does not consider these differences and therefore is neither efficient nor equitable. Improvements in efficiency (resource use) and equity (income distribution) are associated with (1) a shift of water to the lower zone, and (2) the use of lower levels of irrigation intensity upstream. Furthermore, the scenarios that result in the most efficient use of resources also bring the greatest degree of equity in income distribution, indicating that these may be complementary, not conflicting, goals. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Priorities should reflect the risk ecosystems are facing and how represented they are in current national reserve networks (NRN). Conservation planning, research, and reserve design should focus on priority ecosystems. This study identified the priority ecosystems for the conservation of continental Ecuador\'s biodiversity using a multi-criteria model developed in collaboration with Ecuador\'s Ministry of the Environment. This model ranked ecosystems based on four conditions: representativeness in the current reserve network, human pressure, habitat loss, and species-level value based on bird species data. Results show that although Ecuador\'s reserve network covers approximately 14% of the country, several ecosystems are poorly represented using a conservative 10% level benchmark, while others are not included at all. In general, highly diverse, humid environments are well represented while low-diversity, dry environments, are poorly represented. These low-diversity, low-representation ecosystems are also the most threatened. Conservation programs and new reserves design in continental Ecuador should concentrate on these ecosystems until the desired representativeness is attained. These results were formally presented to Ecuador\'s Ministry of the Environment in 2000. This study shows that an ecosystem-risk-representativeness approach can be implemented efficiently at scales that take advantage of limited resources yet are effective for policy and planning.

The intensity of the direct influence of energy-industry investment (0.049) on economic performance lags behind the feedback influence of economic performance (1.069) on energy-industry investment. Additionally, considerable heterogeneities are detected in influence intensities across the regional panels. Eastern China (region of high development) displayed the most substantial direct (0.058) and feedback influence (1.193), while western China manifested the least substantial intensity of direct (0.030) and feedback influence (0.836). After that, the central China (region of medium development) demonstrated a medium intensity of direct (0.037) and feedback influence (0.996). Finally, among other regressors, human capital, physical capital, inflation rate, and trade presented a positive and significant influence on economic performance. In contrast, the foreign direct investment significantly influenced the economic performance only in the eastern China. The empirical findings implied that energy-industry investment might serve as a vital driver of economic performance, with the most significant role in the highly developed regions and the least significant in the low developed regions, given the important explanatory variables.

For HAP, the barriers were lack of confidence in the PCP and complexity of the patient. As a conclusion, DETELPROG referral model provides a lot of advantages and does not pose any new barrier to face-to-face referral or other non-face-to-face referral models, so it should be implemented in primary care. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, it presents a new measurement method, incorporating, but simplifying, a complex range of variables, which can be crystallized into a set of items (questions) to determine businesses’ commitment to entrepreneurship sustainability—social, economic, and environmental. The results can be cross-referenced with other relevant variables, and indicators proposed by the UN, to determine what causal or explanatory relationships might or might not exist. The proposal represents a valuable extension to existing data gathering tools, and will be of use to researchers and practitioners in the field of entrepreneurship—especially as its sustainability credentials and environmental impact are in the spotlight. © 2021 by the authors.

The process of Sustainability Enterprise Risk Management (SERM) is typically implemented to integrate all social, economic, environmental, and technological aspects in a systematic way to properly manage emerging risks and other non-quantifiable risks for company survival. Therefore, in this study, an attempt has been carried out to develop a comprehensive framework to implement the ERM framework under the sustainability platform by considering 29 sub-criteria based on four main aspects, including social, environmental, technological, and economic. In addition, a new fuzzy decision-making approach using the VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje) approach under q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFSs) called VIKOR-q-ROFSs approach is introduced to identify, rank, and evaluate the main criteria of SERM in the universal appeal for all industries such as Chinese manufacturing Small And Mid-Size Enterprises (SMEs) based on expert opinions and literature review. To determine the weights of SERM criteria by the decision experts, this study has introduced q-ROFNs. Moreover, to facilitate the q-ROFNs, a novel q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging operator (q-ROFWAO) is proposed. Furthermore, VIKOR is applied to rank and evaluate the manufacturing SMEs as the alternatives for this study. The results of this paper showed that technological suitability was the important risk factor followed by technological advance, occupational safety and health, product and services responsibility, (benefit) anti-corruption labor practices, and technological practicability.

Around 510,975 km2 (±69,877 km2) of land changed over the 30 years at an average of ~17,033 km2 yr−1 (±2329 km2 yr−1). Cropland and Forests declined by ~64,836 km2 (±16,437 km2) and ~ 152,492 km2 (±24,749 km2) over 30 years, mainly converting to Grassland.

Using a spatially and temporally resolved approach, we analyzed three scenarios for year 2030 for Northeast Brazil, characterized by 30%, 45%, and 70% of VRE (the latter corresponds to 100% renewable energy). We find that accounting for the health impacts from electricity generation is sufficient to economically justify deep decarbonization of Northeast Brazil\'s power sector. Full decarbonization is economically justified when the carbon price exceeds $20/tonne CO2, which is less than Brazil\'s country-level social cost of carbon and only 4.8% of the global social cost of carbon. Our study shows that regional climate and health costs from electricity generation alone can be greater than the additional infrastructure costs of decarbonization.

These “protective” microbes are known as biocontrol agents (BCA). BCA either limit or inhibit the growth of plant pathogens, owing to the excretion of a panoply of secondary metabolites (including soluble and volatile antibiotics, siderophores, quorum sensing interfering agents). BCA can also control plant pathogens through indirect mechanisms, including competence for nutrients and space, or else by interfering with their chemical communication. That explains why some of these BCA have been included in the formulation of commercial biopesticides, which are environmentally friendly products containing live cells used to control plant diseases and pests. At present, the development of biopesticides from mesophilic microorganisms is an established technology. Unfortunately, these biopesticides are not active at low temperatures. On the other hand, the information concerning the potential use of CA-BCA for the same goal is at its infancy. Here, we review the current knowledge concerning the isolation, identification, and characterization of CA microbes which act as antagonists of plant pathogens, including the mechanisms they deploy to antagonize plant pathogens. We also illustrate their biotechnological potential to develop CA biopesticides and discuss their utility in the context of mountainous agriculture. Key points: • Many naturally occurring cold-active microbes antagonize plant pathogens. • The mechanisms of biocontrol exerted by these microbes are either direct or indirect. • Cold-active biocontrol agents can be used to develop biopesticides. • Cold-active biopesticides are crucial for sustainably intensifying agriculture in cold climates. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\",\"Bacteria', 93),

Bacalao is an overfished regionally endemic fish species, characterized by low resilience, high market and cultural value and high spatial overlap with the fishery. Our results suggested that bacalao is a species of high management priority, requiring urgent measures to prevent fisheries\' collapse. In addition, if current fishing pressure persists, other related species may become threatened in the near future. We also evaluated different management scenarios using this approach. Results suggested that the inclusion of additional no-take zones in the marine reserve, comprising key nursery habitats (such as mangroves) and spawning aggregation sites, would be necessary to reduce species vulnerability and to benefit other related species.

Thus, regional poverty increases when the level of schooling increases in neighboring cantons. On the other hand, in cantons with a high Mestizo population, compared to the African-American population, the poverty of the canton and its neighboring regions decreases.

Conclusion The findings supported the HBM as a way to predict intentions to prevent infestation of the home by triatomine bugs. The findings highlight that messages emphasizing self-efficacy in participating in surveillance systems and overcoming barriers to small-scale action that reduce likelihood of infestation, rather than a focus on risk, should be central messages when designing and implementing educational interventions for CD.

Worldwide, the adolescent fertility rate is 46.7 live births per 1000 women between 15-19 years, but in less developed regions these rates increase to 101.7 live births in Africa and 68 live births in Latin America, representing an important public health problem. In this sense, Latin America and the Caribbean are some of the regions with the lowest percentage of decrease in the last decades and have the highest frequency of teenage pregnancies of global fertility, with an approximate 18%.

The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

(294, 'these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990—neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases—were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. Interpretation: Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data on both multinationals and locally owned firms from 14 OECD countries, collected through the Cranet 2009 survey. The hypotheses of the proposed model were tested using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Findings: Evidence shows that the strategic HR function is positively related to the adoption of both types of HRM practices, whereas higher levels of union presence inhibit the adoption of performance-centered practices and promote the adoption of person-centered practices. In addition, although VoC does not show any significant direct effects on HR practices, there is a moderating effect of VoC on the HR function role – HRM practices and union presence – HRM practices relationships. Research limitations/implications: The use of survey data with single respondents might produce reliability problems. Additionally, the data used are cross-sectional, which means that causality cannot be determined. Practical implications: Managers in multinationals corporations and local firms must be aware of the distinct effects of the strategic HR function and trade union presence in different market economies. In particular, special attention must be paid when a firm expands globally, “outside the reach” of the national market economy or type of capitalism, and operates in different VoC. Originality/value: The present paper contributes to better understanding the influence of VoC, not only on HRM practices, as in previous research, but also on the relationships between the HR function role and the level of union presence and the types of practices promoted. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.\",\"HR function', 310),

We classified women and children as indigenous, of African descent, or other ancestry (reference group) on the basis of their self-reported ethnicity or language. Mediating variables included wealth quintiles (based on household asset indices), woman\'s education, and urban-rural residence. We calculated crude and adjusted coverage ratios using Poisson regression. Findings: Ethnic gaps in coverage varied substantially from country to country. In most countries, coverage with modern contraception (median coverage ratio 0·82, IQR 0·66–0·92), antenatal care (0·86, 0·75–0·94), and skilled birth attendants (0·75, 0·68–0·92) was lower among indigenous women than in the reference group. Only three countries (Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay) showed significant gaps in DPT3 coverage between the indigenous and the reference groups. The differences were attenuated but persisted after adjustment for wealth, education, and residence. Women and children of African descent showed similar coverage to the reference group in most countries. Interpretation: The lower coverage levels for indigenous women are pervasive, and cannot be explained solely by differences in wealth, education, or residence. Interventions delivered at community level—such as vaccines—show less inequality than those requiring access to services, such as birth attendance. Regular monitoring of ethnic inequalities is essential to evaluate existing initiatives aimed at the inclusion of minorities and to plan effective multisectoral policies and programmes.

Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality.

Our conceptual model treats solar energy, river flow, and tides as forcing functions that control the properties of estuarine ecosystems, but also describes market forces and cultural policies as constraints on properties of socioeconomic systems. The controversy of coastal resource management in Ecuador centers around the relative impacts of shrimp pond construction and management as negative feedbacks to the environmental quality of the Guayas River estuary. Unique oceanographic processes and land use changes contribute to complex issues of water and habitat quality in this tropical estuary, the largest estuarine complex on the Pacific coast of South America. A dynamic box model was developed for the estuary and calibrated with data collected from a 14 month survey of water quality parameters throughout the estuary. Scenarios included conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds in three regions of the estuary, and the construction of a dam by varying three different rates of river discharge at 100, 50 and 10% of 1989 base flow. Good water quality is maintained by the low residence time of water in the estuary (11 d) because of seasonally high river flow and tidal exchange. With a 90% reduction of mangrove forests in the estuary caused by shrimp pond construction, total nitrogen concentrations increased 5 fold. However, as river discharge decreased to 10%, the same construction caused a 60 fold increase in nitrogen concentrations to 250 μM. Increases in nitrogen concentrations were higher in the upper estuary region, with much less change in the lower estuary. Thus the sensitivity of environmental quality to changes in land use in the intertidal and upland zone are linked to the hydrography of the estuary and is site specific. In the future, the combinations of these ecological models together with economic analyses of the goods and services of mangroves may provide better techniques to evaluate the economic impacts of specific coastal zone management decisions.\",\"Ecological economics', 461),

Design: Adult anthropometry was collected through serial case-control studies repeated over a decade across twenty-eight communities. At the same time, anthropometry and hemoglobin were measured for all children under five in every community. Setting: Northern coastal Ecuador. Participants: Adults (N=1665) and children under five (N=2618). Results: From 2003 and 2013, OW/OB increased from 25.1% to 44.8% among men and 59.9% to 70.2% among women. The inverse relationship between remoteness and OW/OB in men was attenuated when adjusting for urban employment, suggesting that livelihoods mediated the remoteness-OW/OB relationship. No such relationship was observed among women. Communities with a higher prevalence of male OW/OB also had a greater prevalence of stunting, but not anemia, in children under five. Conclusions: The association between male OW/OB and child stunting at the community level, but not the household level, suggests that changing food environments, rather than household-or individual-level factors, drove these trends. A closer examination of changing socioeconomic structures and food environments in communities undergoing rapid development could help mitigate future public health burdens. © The Authors 2020.\",\"Afro-Ecuadorian', 195),

Management practices also varied based on mode of decomposition and other ecological requirements such as the following: zero tillage and minimal disturbance in areas where obunegyere grow, heaping banana and spear grass residues under the cool ficus trees which also keep them away from banana stump that may cause infestation with nematodes and insects. Even within the generic practices accessibility by the users is critical for example placing logs near homes where children can use them to play, they can be used as fire wood and to even get off-season mushroom as household waste water can make the mushrooms grow. Conclusions: Our description of artisanal mycoculture methods that respond to conservation and utilization pressures, demonstrates the value of addressing traditional knowledge to improve ethno-biology and mycoculture industry practice. Traditional communities engage in multiple technological and organizational innovations and practices for sustainability and in the case of mushroom production to conserve the environment and culture, ensure variety, food and nutrition security, and income. The results of this study present opportunities to preserve ecosystem quality while developing an artisanal mycoculture system. They have also identified aspects of artisanal mycoculture that most urgently require further ethno-biological study and industry development. Future research and industry development can utilize the result of this study to boost artisanal production of wild saprophytic mushrooms in Sub-Saharan countries, for food or medicinal consumption, and environment conservation. Further development of production efficiencies in context with sustainable natural resource management is recommended. © 2019 The Author(s).\",\"Artisanal production', 197),

Tree species assembly decreases across cocoa agroforest established in reduced fallow periods. Also, absence of fallow intervals of SA affects tree conservation rates in AFSs by changing floristic composition. Nevertheless, the use of AFSs with complex arboreal structures under SA preserves and protects higher rates of native and endangered endemic species and delays forest degradation rates. The conservation of native species in this agricultural model may meet the requirements to reverse the cycle of land degradation and social deprivation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.\",\"Agroforestry systems', 208),

Interpretation: The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health-related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health-related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence-related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gains—curative interventions in the case of NCDs—towards multisectoral, prevention-oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the SDGs. What is clear is that our actions—or inaction—today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030.

Because of sparse data, fertility at ages 10–14 years and 50–54 years was estimated from data on fertility in women aged 15–19 years and 45–49 years, through use of linear regression. Age-specific mortality data came from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimates. Data on population came from 1257 censuses and 761 population registry location-years and were adjusted for underenumeration and age misreporting with standard demographic methods. Migration was estimated with the GBD Bayesian demographic balancing model, after incorporating information about refugee migration into the model prior. Final population estimates used the cohort-component method of population projection, with inputs of fertility, mortality, and migration data. Population uncertainty was estimated by use of out-of-sample predictive validity testing. With these data, we estimated the trends in population by age and sex and in fertility by age between 1950 and 2017 in 195 countries and territories. Findings: From 1950 to 2017, TFRs decreased by 49·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 46·4–52·0). The TFR decreased from 4·7 livebirths (4·5–4·9) to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·5), and the ASFR of mothers aged 10–19 years decreased from 37 livebirths (34–40) to 22 livebirths (19–24) per 1000 women. Despite reductions in the TFR, the global population has been increasing by an average of 83·8 million people per year since 1985. The global population increased by 197·2% (193·3–200·8) since 1950, from 2·6 billion (2·5–2·6) to 7·6 billion (7·4–7·9) people in 2017', 306),

Younger residents (X2 = 12.960, df = 2, p = 0.002), respondents perceiving benefits from the Park (X2 = 14.292, df = 2, p = 0.001), and respondents reporting good relations with the Park staff (X2 = 5.514, df = 1, p = 0.019), were more positive towards the Park. Factors influencing public attitudes are compared with study results in other countries. Negative attitudes stemmed from (1) a lack of public participation in the Park\'s creation and a misunderstanding of the National Park concept, (2) perceived restrictions on resource-use outweighing perceived benefits from the Park, and (3) conflicts between local inhabitants and the Park staff. Attitudes towards Machalilla National Park do not differ markedly between people living within or adjacent to the Park (F = 1.04, p = 0.8741). The results indicate management policies that would be needed to improve incorporation of the human populations into long-term strategies for sustaining the Park. A multifaceted approach, incorporating community involvement, environmental education, the development of feasible economic alternatives, and long-term social as well as ecological monitoring, is needed to attain also the goal of conserving biological diversity. The survey provided meaningful information for administrative decision-making and will provide data for monitoring the efficacy of subsequent policies. © 1995, Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

Secondary objectives were to study determinants of healthcare-seeking behavior, compare health expenditure with expenditure from the past ordinary illness, and measure the prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure related to perceived emergencies. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 210 households in a rural region of northwestern Ecuador. The households were sampled with two-stage cluster sampling and represent an estimated 20% of the households in the region. We used two structured, pretested questionnaires. The first questionnaire collected demographic and economic household data, expenditure data on the past ordinary illness, and presented our definition of perceived emergency. The second recorded the number of emergency events, symptoms, further case description, healthcare-seeking behavior, and health expenditure, which was defined as being catastrophic when it exceeded 40% of a household´s ability to pay. Results: The response rate was 85% with a total of 74 reported emergency events during the past year (90/1,000 inhabitants). We further analyzed the most recent event in each household (n=54). Private, for-profit providers, including traditional healers, were chosen by 57.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] [44-71%]). Public providers treated one third of the cases. The mean health expenditure per event was $305.30 United States dollars (USD), compared to $135.80 USD for the past ordinary illnesses. Catastrophic health expenditure was found in 24.4% of households. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the provision of free health services may not be sufficient to reach universal health coverage for patients with perceived emergencies. Changes in the organization of public emergency departments and improved financial protection for emergency patients may improve the situation. © 2018 Eckhardt et al.\",,\"adult', 312),

Whereas most of these commodities were locally consumed, as many as 980,084 children (around 10%) worked for exports, more than what is typically assumed. Exports mainly consisted of agricultural and food products, clothing, minerals, and construction materials and were predominantly destined to 26 countries, the United States ranking first.

TFO30 was higher than TFU25 in 145 countries and territories in 2017. 33 countries had a negative population growth rate from 2010 to 2017, most of which were located in central, eastern, and western Europe, whereas population growth rates of more than 2·0% were seen in 33 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, less than 65% of the national population was of working age in 12 of 34 high-income countries, and less than 50% of the national population was of working age in Mali, Chad, and Niger. Interpretation: Population trends create demographic dividends and headwinds (ie, economic benefits and detriments) that affect national economies and determine national planning needs. Although TFRs are decreasing, the global population continues to grow as mortality declines, with diverse patterns at the national level and across age groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide transparent and replicable estimates of population and fertility, which can be used to inform decision making and to monitor progress.

To address this issue, we determined the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) for bioethanol and biodiesel. The selection of raw materials relied on their productive capacity, export and import records, and historical yields. Consequently, the scope included three raw materials for ethanol (sugar cane, corn, and forest residues) and four for biodiesel (African palm, pinion, bovine fat, and swine fat). Using a method based on the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of each biofuel, we assessed the entire production chain through statistical processing of primary and secondary information. Then we calculated the calorific values in the laboratory, compared energy inputs/outputs, and finally obtained the energetic returns. EROIs for bioethanol were: 1.797 for sugarcane, 1.040 for corn, and 0.739 for wood. The results for biodiesel were: 3.052 for African palm, 2.743 for pinion, 2.187 for bovine fat, and 2.891 for swine fat. These values suggest feasibility only for sugarcane in the case of ethanol. In contrast, biodiesel has better prospects because all the feedstocks analyzed had EROIs higher than two. Nevertheless, biodiesel is not available for trading in Ecuador because energy policy has overlooked systems based on higher energy return. Future studies should consider more comprehensive variables such as climate change, land use, and water management. © 2020 The Author(s)\",\"Biofuel', 135),
